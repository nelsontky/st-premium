    <p>With­out much choice, Malaysia’s rul­ing party Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (PPBM) has fi­nally opted to join Muafakat Na­sional (MN) and work with its ri­vals/al­lies Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>That said, these three par­ties have their own cal­cu­la­tions and are wrestling among them­selves for supremacy.</p>
    <p>While Umno and PAS have vowed to sup­port cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin as post-GE15 PM, this will re­main an un­cer­tainty un­til the day comes.</p>
    <p>Ever since their tie-up, Umno and PAS have been largely in­vin­ci­ble, hav­ing tri­umphed in suc­ces­sive state and par­lia­men­tary by-elec­tions.</p>
    <p>This has boosted the con­fi­dence of the two par­ties and they in­sist they can re­cap­ture all the 21 par­lia­men­tary seats lost to Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) in the last elec­tion, by virtue of their big­ger com­bined votes vis-a-vis PH’s elected can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>PPBM’s base in Muafakat is weak and frail, and the party will not have too much say in the al­liance.</p>
    <p>PAS, mean­while, is the least cred­i­ble part­ner. Its pres­i­dent Hadi Awang is an op­por­tunist who tied up with Umno to form MN and col­lab­o­rated with PPBM to reg­is­ter Perikatan Na­sional, which Umno is not in favour of. Strad­dling the two al­liances gives Datuk Seri Hadi bloated con­fi­dence, ar­gu­ing that his party has never been dis­ad­van­taged once in all its past and present col­lu­sions.</p>
    <p>In the 2013 gen­eral elec­tion, PAS was still a com­po­nent of Pakatan Rakyat, and un­der the guise of the “Orange Book”, the party’s “Is­lamic state” ad­vo­cacy was painted as “wel­fare state”, ef­fec­tively re­mov­ing the psy­cho­log­i­cal bar­rier among the lo­cal Chi­nese vot­ers who cast their bal­lots in favour of it.</p>
    <p>PAS not only man­aged to cap­ture more state seats, but also suc­cess­fully ex­panded its clout from its East Coast home ground to the central and south­ern parts of the West Coast.</p>
    <p>PAS has never once at­tempted to con­ceal its ul­te­rior mo­tives of en­act­ing the hudud law and erect­ing an Is­lamic state de­spite some strate­gic mod­i­fi­ca­tions over time. The party has learnt to be more com­posed now, and is pa­tiently wait­ing for the right mo­ment to act.</p>
    <p>With three Malay par­ties now com­ing un­der the same um­brella, MN will only be more con­ser­va­tive, racist and reli­gious.</p>
    <p>While the par­ties may have their own plans, their tar­get is uni­tary in the face of an “imag­i­nary foe” which Chi­nese Malaysians are made to por­tray.</p>
    <p>An even­tu­al­ity of mono­ra­cial pol­i­tics is racial and reli­gious supremacy of a sin­gle com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>PPBM Youth chair­man Wan Ah­mad Fayshal has vowed to phase out ver­nac­u­lar schools in stages, while PAS MP for Pasir Puteh Nik Muham­mad Zawawi Salleh in­curred pub­lic fury for his mis­in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the Bible. These politi­cians have openly de­fied the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion as well as the sanc­ti­fied prin­ci­ples of the Rukun Ne­gara (the “Na­tional Prin­ci­ples” de­clared on Merdeka Day in 1970). And Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din has opted to ig­nore their ac­tions.</p>
    <p>To firm up their hold on power, many politi­cians have be­come se­lec­tively am­nesic.</p>
    <p>They have for­got­ten how the three ma­jor eth­nic com­mu­ni­ties worked to­gether to fight for the na­tion’s in­de­pen­dence. They should fol­low the foot­steps of the na­tion’s found­ing fa­thers and up­hold plu­ral­ism in­stead of em­brac­ing sin­gle-race pol­i­tics. By this choice, they will take the coun­try down the road of no re­turn!</p>
    <p>Save for Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, there isn’t another party that is ver­i­ta­bly mul­tira­cial.</p>
    <p>De­spite years of ef­forts, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party has failed to lure the Malay elec­torate to this day.</p>
    <p>Although Ger­akan Rakyat claims it is mul­tira­cial, its Malay mem­ber­ship is very in­signif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>What about for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad? He is a 100 per cent racist-op­por­tunist.</p>
    <p>From Umno in the past, to PPBM set up be­fore the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion, to the newly es­tab­lished Pe­juang af­ter his ex­pul­sion from the party he founded a cou­ple of years ago, all these are very much mono­ra­cial par­ties. Never once in his decades-old po­lit­i­cal ca­reer has he ever en­dorsed plu­ral­ism.</p>
    <p>No, not once in his two tenures as PM!</p>
    <p>For­mer youth and sports min­is­ter Syed Sad­diq looks like he is be­gin­ning to walk out of the old man’s shadow, as he plans to set up a mul­tira­cial party by the youth and for the youth. Although such a party dom­i­nated by the youth may not gain much trac­tion in our con­ser­va­tive so­ci­ety, it is nev­er­the­less a great idea and nice at­tempt in ton­ing down racism and breath­ing a new lease of life into the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Look­ing all around the par­lia­men­tary hall, you will not fail to spot a bunch of ar­ro­gant, ig­no­rant and un­ruly old faces who love to make sense­less, and at times sex­ist, ut­ter­ances, not to men­tion rowdy in­ter­rup­tions by op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers and a rogue elected rep who once condoned his son con­fronting a ri­val MP within the Par­lia­ment com­pound.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent tweet, Mr Syed Sad­diq urged his mil­lion-strong fol­low­ers to “re­mem­ber these old faces” and vote them out in GE15.</p>
    <p>The Par­lia­ment amended the Con­sti­tu­tion last year to lower the vot­ing age and im­ple­ment au­to­matic new voter reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In the next gen­eral elec­tion, there will be 3.8 mil­lion first-time vot­ers above the age of 18, giv­ing the new party pro­posed by Mr Syed Sad­diq a good boost.</p>
    <p>Let’s hope these young lead­ers, ir­re­spec­tive of race and re­li­gion, will take the coun­try fur­ther from here in the years to come.</p>
    <p>The New Malaysia that many of us have been dream­ing of is still nowhere in sight. Per­haps peo­ple my age will not get to see it in our life­time. Hope­fully, our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren will. While we can get dis­ap­pointed, we must not give up hope!</p>
