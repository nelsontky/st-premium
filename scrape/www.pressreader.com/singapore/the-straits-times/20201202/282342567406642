    <p>CapitaLand has divested three malls in Ja­pan and an of­fice build­ing in South Korea for a to­tal of $448.7 mil­lion, as part of its on­go­ing port­fo­lio re­con­sti­tu­tion strat­egy, it said yes­ter­day in an ex­change fil­ing.</p>
    <p>The real es­tate gi­ant also an­nounced it has made its first foray into Ja­pan’s lo­gis­tics sec­tor, en­ter­ing into a joint ven­ture with Mit­sui & Co Real Es­tate, with CapitaLand as the ma­jor­ity part­ner, to de­velop and op­er­ate a lo­gis­tics project in Greater Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The divested prop­er­ties in Ja­pan are La Park Mizue and Vivit Mi­nami-Fun­abashi in Greater Tokyo, as well as Co-op Kobe Nishi­nomiya Hi­gashi in Greater Osaka, which were sold for a to­tal of 21.99 bil­lion yen (S$283.6 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>It also divested Icon Yeok­sam in Seoul for 142.2 bil­lion won (S$165.1 mil­lion) in Au­gust. The of­fice build­ing was held through a pri­vate fund, As­cen­das Korea Of­fice Pri­vate Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust (Reit) 5. CapitaLand re­mains the as­set man­ager of Icon Yeok­sam and will con­tinue to re­ceive fee in­come.</p>
    <p>The group said the di­vest­ments were done above val­u­a­tion, and the buy­ers are un­re­lated third par­ties. Post-di­vest­ment, CapitaLand will re­tain $3.8 bil­lion of as­sets un­der man­age­ment (AUM) in Ja­pan and $2 bil­lion of AUM in South Korea.</p>
    <p>With the di­vest­ments, the to­tal gross value of di­vest­ments by CapitaLand and its Reits would be $3.02 bil­lion, cross­ing its an­nual tar­get of re­cy­cling $3 bil­lion of cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>CapitaLand and its Reits have in­vested more than $3.3 bil­lion in new as­sets as at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>“The di­vest­ment of th­ese ma­ture malls and of­fice as­set is part of CapitaLand’s cap­i­tal re­cy­cling strat­egy to un­lock value by rein­vest­ing the cap­i­tal into new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties such as the lo­gis­tics sec­tor in Ja­pan,” said Mr Ja­son Leow, pres­i­dent, Sin­ga­pore and In­ter­na­tional, CapitaLand Group.</p>
    <p>“By par­ing down our ex­po­sure in Ja­pan’s re­tail sec­tor and lever­ag­ing our lo­gis­tics ex­pe­ri­ence in mar­kets such as Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia and the United King­dom to ex­pand into the new econ­omy sec­tor in Ja­pan, we are re­spond­ing swiftly to shift­ing mar­ket trends and con­sumer be­hav­iours, po­si­tion­ing CapitaLand for fu­ture growth,” he added.</p>
    <p>Its new lo­gis­tics ven­ture in Ja­pan is close to cen­tral Tokyo and is ex­pected to be com­pleted in the fourth quar­ter of 2022. The four-storey lo­gis­tics fa­cil­ity will have a gross floor area of about 24,000 sq m.</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald Yong, chief ex­ec­u­tive at CapitaLand In­ter­na­tional, said Ja­pan’s lo­gis­tics sec­tor presents sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­ni­ties for the group. “The global pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the growth of e-com­merce, and the lo­gis­tics sec­tor has been a prime ben­e­fi­ciary of this trend,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We aim to achieve mean­ing­ful scale over time by lever­ag­ing Mit­sui & Co Real Es­tate’s lo­cal knowl­edge and ac­cess to busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties to grow our lo­gis­tics port­fo­lio in Ja­pan.”</p>
    <p>CapitaLand shares closed at $3.12 yes­ter­day, down 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Post-di­vest­ment, CapitaLand will re­tain $3.8 bil­lion of as­sets un­der man­age­ment (AUM) in Ja­pan and $2 bil­lion of AUM in South Korea.</p>
