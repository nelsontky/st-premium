    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern yes­ter­day vowed to tackle the coun­try’s chronic hous­ing short­age, fo­cus­ing on a vul­ner­a­ble elec­tion is­sue for the Labour Party ahead of early vot­ing start­ing this week­end.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern is ex­pected to se­cure re-elec­tion in the Oct 17 polls af­ter win­ning praise for her han­dling of the Covid-19 out­break and other crises, but Labour has done less well on some do­mes­tic is­sues, in­clud­ing plans to build new homes and rein in the cost of hous­ing.</p>
    <p>The Labour-led coali­tion’s am­bi­tious af­ford­able hous­ing project to build 100,000 homes within a decade has fal­tered, with only 600 homes be­ing built so far and about 1,000 un­der con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms Ardern promised to de­liver more homes and re­place a 30-year-old law blamed for high hous­ing costs and im­ped­ing ur­ban de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Overly re­stric­tive plan­ning rules are one of the causes of high house prices,” Ms Ardern said, adding that she was de­ter­mined to re­move bar­ri­ers to the sup­ply of land and in­fras­truc­ture for hous­ing, in­clud­ing re­plac­ing the coun­try’s Re­source Man­age­ment Act (RMA).</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s house prices have soared nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, an­a­lysts say, due to a short­age of over 100,000 homes.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sive gov­ern­ments have failed to ease the red tape around land ap­proval, mak­ing land ar­ti­fi­cially scarce. For pri­vate devel­op­ers, the costs and con­sent process are sig­nif­i­cant hur­dles, mak­ing prop­er­ties un­af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said the party would also sup­port first home buy­ers with loans and in­tro­duce reg­u­la­tions for prop­erty man­age­ment ser­vices.</p>
    <p>While opinion polls sug­gest Ms Ardern is on track for a com­fort­able win to se­cure a sec­ond three-year term, the op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party has been claw­ing back sup­port.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Party leader Ju­dith Collins, whose party had said pre­vi­ously it would scrap the RMA, yes­ter­day dis­missed Ms Ardern’s hous­ing plans as copy­ing its own. “What Labour’s hous­ing an­nounce­ment is, is an ad­mis­sion of three years of fail­ure,” Ms Collins said.</p>
    <p>Nearly 450 advance polling sta­tions will open their doors to­day. Pre­lim­i­nary re­sults will be an­nounced on Oct 17.</p>
