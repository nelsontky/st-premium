    <p>Hurl­ing pro­fan­i­ties, jeering sup­port­ers of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump – in­clud­ing a woman wear­ing an “I love Trump” shirt with the let­ter “Q” on the back, sym­bol of the QAnon con­spir­acy the­ory – heck­led Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham, who was on his way to catch a flight on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The sen­a­tor, who has been a dogged Trump loy­al­ist, seemed com­pelled to break with the Pres­i­dent on Wed­nes­day when he said the Se­nate should not over­turn the re­sult of the elec­tion Mr Trump lost. Mr Gra­ham needed a po­lice es­cort as he walked through Ron­ald Rea­gan Wash­ing­ton Na­tional Air­port to board his flight.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent spoke vol­umes. Mr Trump’s power base is per­sonal. And the more be­lea­guered he seems, the more his base ral­lies around him.</p>
    <p>The choice fac­ing many Repub­li­can sen­a­tors and rep­re­sen­ta­tives is whether to risk alien­at­ing that base – be­cause in that uni­verse, you are ei­ther 100 per cent for Mr Trump, or you are an en­emy.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party is gear­ing up to im­peach Pres­i­dent Trump a sec­ond time, to make a point of ac­count­abil­ity for Wed­nes­day’s storm­ing of the Capi­tol in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The first im­peach­ment was in 2019, on charges of abuse of power and ob­struc­tion of Congress. The Se­nate, with its Repub­li­can ma­jor­ity, ac­quit­ted him.</p>
    <p>SEC­OND IM­PEACH­MENT – BUT LIKELY ACQUITTAL</p>
    <p>“The House will pre­serve ev­ery op­tion – in­clud­ing the 25th Amend­ment, a mo­tion to im­peach or a priv­i­leged res­o­lu­tion for im­peach­ment,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a state­ment on Fri­day af­ter a three-hour meet­ing with House Democrats.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence is re­port­edly not in­clined to in­voke Ar­ti­cle 25, which needs a ma­jor­ity of the Cab­i­net to say the Pres­i­dent must be re­moved from of­fice.</p>
    <p>And the planned sec­ond im­peach­ment will likely go the same route as the first, though Democrats hope that some­how a con­vic­tion in the Se­nate could keep Mr Trump from hold­ing po­lit­i­cal of­fice again – some­thing that might ap­peal to other Repub­li­can hope­fuls look­ing for a path in 2024 as Mr Trump would oth­er­wise be a shoo-in for the nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell in a note on Fri­day, told the Se­nate that ar­ti­cles of im­peach­ment would likely reach on Jan 19, which means they would start pro­ceed­ings and con­tinue af­ter Mr Trump is no longer pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>That would ren­der the ex­er­cise moot – un­less sig­nif­i­cant num­bers of Repub­li­can sen­a­tors de­cide to aban­don Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for the lack of en­thu­si­asm is both fear of fur­ther in­flam­ing the al­ready volatile sit­u­a­tion – a valid fear given rum­blings of more right-wing protests and pos­si­bly even at­tacks in Wash­ing­ton or in state cap­i­tals in the days to come – and the fact that while some Repub­li­cans had tac­ti­cally dis­tanced them­selves from Mr Trump last week, there is no big change of heart in the party.</p>
    <p>REPUB­LI­CANS AT CROSS­ROADS</p>
    <p>Strate­gi­cally, many are eye­ing their own po­lit­i­cal cal­cu­la­tions for the next Se­nate and pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, and alien­at­ing the Trump base may not help.</p>
    <p>Dr T.J. Pem­pel, pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal science at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Berke­ley, told The Sun­day Times: “The more rad­i­cal of Trump’s sup­port­ers, in­clud­ing people like (sen­a­tors) Ted Cruz and Josh Haw­ley… (and) roughly a hun­dred Repub­li­cans in Congress, are look­ing to be em­braced by that Trump base, the kind of Midwestern frus­trated pop­u­lace that feels like its en­tire cul­ture is un­der at­tack by the coasts, by eth­nic­ity, by re­li­gious di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“The choice for the Repub­li­can Party is clear. Do you stay with Trump? Do you al­low him to go for­ward with this ex­ac­er­ba­tion of re­bel­lion and in­sur­rec­tion? Or do you say, ‘Wait a minute, that’s not the fu­ture of the Repub­li­can Party. We have to tone this down.’</p>
    <p>“The risk is if they go for­ward and con­tinue th­ese sort of rad­i­cal chal­lenges to demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions, to free elec­tions, to changes in the tran­si­tion of govern­ment, there’s go­ing to be a split… (with) more mod­er­ate Repub­li­cans.”</p>
    <p>QUALMS, BUT NO CHANGE OF HEART</p>
    <p>For now, even af­ter Wed­nes­day, when pro-Trump mobs egged on by the Pres­i­dent stormed the Capi­tol, in the process bat­ter­ing one po­lice of­fi­cer to death with a fire ex­tin­guisher, top Repub­li­cans at a meet­ing at a lux­ury sea­side re­sort in Florida had lit­tle ap­petite for tak­ing on the Pres­i­dent, The Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Steel, a Repub­li­can con­sul­tant and Trump critic who did not at­tend the event, told the Post: “I don’t know that any sort of for­mal au­topsy process by the party would be use­ful un­til and un­less Don­ald Trump is no longer the dom­i­nant fig­ure in the party.</p>
    <p>“The process of fig­ur­ing out what the post-Trump Repub­li­can Party looks like can’t start un­til af­ter the Pres­i­dent has left the White House. It will in­volve more or­ganic evo­lu­tion than a sharp break.”</p>
    <p>IN­AU­GU­RA­TION</p>
    <p>Mr Pence has said he will be at Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion – a toned down af­fair be­cause of the rag­ing Covid-19 coron­avirus pan­demic, but al­most cer­tainly headed for tighter-than-usual se­cu­rity given the dam­ag­ing de­ba­cle at the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, shortly be­fore be­ing per­ma­nently sus­pended by Twit­ter, an­nounced that he would not at­tend the in­au­gu­ra­tion. What he will do re­mains un­clear, but it is be­lieved he will go to Florida, now his home state, where he stays at his Mar-a-Lago Club es­tate.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously there was talk of him hold­ing a rally in Florida on the same day as the in­au­gu­ra­tion. Noth­ing spe­cific has been an­nounced.</p>
    <p>What Mr Trump will do af­ter Jan­uary 20 re­mains a mat­ter of much spec­u­la­tion. One pos­si­bil­ity is that he will start a new me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tion, alone or in al­liance with an ex­ist­ing right-wing out­let. Among his favourites are One Amer­ica News Net­work and News­max.</p>
    <p>That would get around be­ing de-plat­formed by Twit­ter and main­tain the high-oc­tane vis­i­bil­ity that is his oxy­gen, and keep his power base riled up. Af­ter be­ing banned by Twit­ter on Fri­day, he said in a state­ment: “We have been ne­go­ti­at­ing with var­i­ous other sites, and will have a big an­nounce­ment soon, while we also look at the pos­si­bil­i­ties of build­ing out our own plat­form in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>2024</p>
    <p>In mid-Novem­ber, Mr Trump’s niece, Dr Mary Trump, in an in­ter­view, pre­dicted her un­cle would not run again in 2024, de­spite what he had re­port­edly been say­ing, be­cause he “will never put him­self in a po­si­tion where he can lose like this again”.</p>
    <p>Dr Trump, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist, made waves in July last year with her book Too Much And Never Enough: How My Fam­ily Cre­ated The World’s Most Dan­ger­ous Man.</p>
    <p>The talk of run­ning again was just ego, she told CNN. “He can keep telling ev­ery­one that he re­ally won the 2020 elec­tion and it was stolen from him by fraud (and he will, ad nau­seam), but the prospect of yet another loss would be too fright­en­ing.”</p>
    <p>His health – he is now 74 – may also not hold up, she said. And af­ter leav­ing of­fice, he “may be look­ing at se­ri­ous charges against him”.</p>
    <p>But, asked if Mr Trump would get his sup­port­ers to fight for him, or if that were a bridge too far, she said: “There is no bridge too far.”</p>
