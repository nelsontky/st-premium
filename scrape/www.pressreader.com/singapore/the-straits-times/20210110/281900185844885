    <p>Over the l ast six months, Mr Murteza Kaizar Zakir has worked as a trainee at tech com­pany Neo Aero­nau­tics, with his pay sub­sidised by a govern­ment scheme to help fresh grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>He earns be­tween $2,000 and $2,500 a month, and is hop­ing to be con­verted to a full-time em­ployee by the end of his year-long trainee­ship, which started in July last year.</p>
    <p>“Six months in, I’ve learnt use­ful skills like how to man­age lab equip­ment and op­er­ate var­i­ous ma­chines... I’ve also had the chance to teach sec­ondary school stu­dents the basics of com­puter-aided de­sign,” said Mr Murteza, who has an aero­nau­ti­cal en­gi­neer­ing de­gree.</p>
    <p>As at early last month, the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme has helped more than 4,700 fresh grad­u­ates like Mr Murteza find paid work at a time of se­ri­ous eco­nomic strife.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme was rolled out by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) to help fresh grad­u­ates from in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing boost their em­ploy­a­bil­ity by the time hir­ing de­mand picks up af­ter the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It was set up in part­ner­ship with the Singapore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF), which as­sesses and ap­proves suit­able com­pa­nies to be part of the pro­gramme be­fore they can take in trainees.</p>
    <p>For Mr Murteza, the pro­gramme brought hope. He had sent in 20 job ap­pli­ca­tions be­tween Jan­uary and June last year but none of them bore fruit.</p>
    <p>“It was a dif­fi­cult pe­riod as a num­ber of com­pa­nies in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try were not hir­ing due to the wors­en­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence has been sim­i­lar for Mr Jason Ong, who spent six months try­ing to land a job since March last year.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old, who grad­u­ated in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing from the Univer­sity of Ade­laide in Aus­tralia last July, now works as a trainee at 3D-print­ing firm – 3D Me­tal­forge – earn­ing be­tween $2,000 and $2,500.</p>
    <p>“I’ve learnt how to de­sign and pre­pare mod­els for 3D-print­ing... and be­cause I’m work­ing in a small and medium-sized en­ter­prise, I’ve also been able to see how dif­fer­ent depart­ments op­er­ate,” he said.</p>
    <p>But some like Mr S. Tan, 25, won­der if com­pa­nies are hold­ing back on full-time job of­fers to take ad­van­tage of the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Trainees un­der the pro­gramme re­ceive an es­ti­mated monthly train­ing al­lowance of $1,100 to $2,500 for up to 12 months, of which 80 per cent is funded by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can de­cide to hire them on a full-time ba­sis when the trainee­ship ends.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said that af­ter spend­ing three months from last May as an in­tern in a de­sign com­pany, he was promised a per­ma­nent job with a start­ing pay of $3,000 a month.</p>
    <p>But af­ter the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme was rolled out in June last year, the com­pany of­fered him a trainee po­si­tion in­stead. This was even though it had yet to re­ceive ap­proval to par­tic­i­pate in the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Only af­ter the com­pany failed to get ap­proval to take in trainees did they of­fer me a per­ma­nent job, much to my re­lief,” said the psy­chol­ogy grad­u­ate from the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“They tried to cut my salary to $2,500 to match that of a trainee’s pay, so I ne­go­ti­ated with them. While my salary was in­creased to $2,800, which I’m thank­ful for, it was not re­stored to the amount that was promised in the be­gin­ning,” said Mr Tan, who is still with the firm.</p>
    <p>AP­PROVAL NEEDED</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that in­tend to take part in the trainee­ship pro­gramme have to ap­ply for ap­proval from SBF.</p>
    <p>Work­force Singapore (WSG), a govern­ment agency which sup­ports the trainee­ship pro­gramme, told The Sun­day Times that com­pa­nies are se­lected based on whether they are able to help trainees ac­quire use­ful skills, as well as their busi­ness needs.</p>
    <p>As at Dec 6 last year, more than 4,600 com­pa­nies had re­ceived ap­proval to take in trainees.</p>
    <p>Large or­gan­i­sa­tions like DBS Bank and Sing­tel are trans­par­ent in spell­ing out roles, re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and wages on job sites.</p>
    <p>Their trainee­ships are ad­ver­tised on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture jobs por­tal, which states that it is part of the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>But other firms are not so clear.</p>
    <p>Mr J. L said he was mis­led as the trainee­ship he se­cured in July last year, af­ter three rounds of in­ter­views, had been ad­ver­tised as a “full-time job for grad­u­ates”.</p>
    <p>“I felt duped... the time I had ded­i­cated try­ing to se­cure this ‘job’ was sunk cost. If I had known bet­ter, I could have pri­ori­tised my time to im­prove my chances else­where,” said the 25-year-old po­lit­i­cal science grad­u­ate from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore (NUS).</p>
    <p>De­spite his un­easi­ness, Mr L de­cided to take up the role, which pays $2,500 a month, as it was the fur­thest he had reached in his job search. He had ap­plied to more than 40 com­pa­nies over four months to no avail.</p>
    <p>Like Mr L, 23-year-old Ni­cole (not her real name) was elated to se­cure a full-time job pay­ing $3,000 last May. But when the trainee­ship pro­gramme was launched, it was switched to trainee­ship terms, even though she had al­ready signed her em­ploy­ment con­tract.</p>
    <p>“My em­ployer told me that I had to ac­cept the new ar­range­ment or I would be let go.</p>
    <p>“I had to agree as it’s so chal­leng­ing to find another job in this pan­demic, and hav­ing a trainee­ship is bet­ter than hav­ing noth­ing at all,” said Ni­cole, an NUS phi­los­o­phy grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>Her salary was re­vised down­wards from $3,000 to $2,500 a month. She also stopped re­ceiv­ing</p>
    <p>con­tri­bu­tions to her Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund and over­time pay, with the com­pany say­ing she was no longer cov­ered un­der the Em­ploy­ment Act which en­ti­tles her to th­ese rights.</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to seek re­course, Ni­cole turned to SBF, which had ap­proved the com­pany she worked for to par­tic­i­pate in the trainee­ship pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>She has yet to re­ceive a re­ply. SBF de­clined to com­ment when con­tacted by The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Ni­cole even­tu­ally left the com­pany in Septem­ber last year af­ter se­cur­ing a full-time job with another firm.</p>
    <p>Hu­man re­sources (HR) prac­ti­tion­ers The Sun­day Times ap­proached said com­pa­nies need to be clear when speak­ing to po­ten­tial em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“HR should be trans­par­ent in their ad­ver­tise­ment when re­cruit­ing trainees and not change the of­fer from full-time role to trainee,” said Singapore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo Chek Wee, head of hu­man cap­i­tal at in­vest­ment firm The Straits Trad­ing Com­pany, said po­ten­tial trainees have ev­ery right to learn about the com­pany, the role and their su­per­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>“If the com­pany is not will­ing to at­tend to th­ese queries, po­ten­tial trainees would have a good in­di­ca­tion on whether they want to join the com­pany or not,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said she is not sur­prised that some em­ploy­ers may also give trainees the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of full­time em­ploy­ees, to man­age their man­power costs dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>“While it may not be the best prac­tice and trainees may feel ‘short-changed’, taken pos­i­tively, trainees can take the op­por­tu­nity to learn as much as they can dur­ing this du­ra­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENT EX­PE­RI­ENCES</p>
    <p>Nine trainees The Sun­day Times reached out to de­scribed dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences un­der the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>While Mr Murteza is glad to have a po­si­tion rel­e­vant to his train­ing, a Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts grad­u­ate who wanted to be known only as Emily got more than she bar­gained for af­ter se­cur­ing a mar­ket­ing trainee po­si­tion at a se­cu­rity sys­tems com­pany last July.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old, who was given a $1,800 al­lowance, had to take on the role of the re­gional man­ager, who had gone on ma­ter­nity leave.</p>
    <p>“I was the only one left in the de­part­ment af­ter the re­gional man­ager went on leave, so I don’t think the com­pany gave me those re­spon­si­bil­i­ties be­cause they thought I was par­tic­u­larly ca­pa­ble.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve they were plan­ning to use the trainee – who­ever it was – as a stop-gap mea­sure,” she said.</p>
    <p>Emily even­tu­ally left the com­pany in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>All the grad­u­ates un­der­stood that the j ob mar­ket was l ean. MOM’s labour mar­ket re­port re­leased last month showed that re­trench­ments rose to 9,120 in the third quar­ter, from 8,130 in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Among res­i­dent em­ploy­ees, the in­ci­dence of re­trench­ments among pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) climbed from 2.7 to 3.7 laid off per 1,000 PMET em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand that it’s tough for both job seek­ers and com­pa­nies dur­ing a re­ces­sion, but it’s still bet­ter for com­pa­nies to be trans­par­ent so people know what they’re get­ting them­selves into,” said Mr L, who is still with the com­pany which pro­vides train­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to The Sun­day Times’ queries, MOM said that each ap­pli­ca­tion by com­pa­nies to par­tic­i­pate in the trainee­ship pro­gramme is scru­ti­nised by SBF to make sure that com­pa­nies are not us­ing the pro­gramme to hire work­ers for per­ma­nent jobs at low cost.</p>
    <p>“Host or­gan­i­sa­tions are re­quired to de­clare in their ap­pli­ca­tions if they have un­der­taken re­trench­ment ex­er­cises or adopted var­i­ous cost-cut­ting mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“If there are grounds to be­lieve that com­pa­nies are re­plac­ing ex­ist­ing em­ploy­ees with trainees in sim­i­lar roles, such ap­pli­ca­tions will be re­jected,” said MOM.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to WSG, SBF has re­jected such ap­pli­ca­tions from or­gan­i­sa­tions be­fore. It did not say how many.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also de­clined to say if there is a quota on the num­ber of trainees a com­pany is al­lowed to hire at any point in time.</p>
    <p>A FRUIT­FUL EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>Six months in, I’ve learnt use­ful skills like how to man­age lab equip­ment and op­er­ate var­i­ous ma­chines... I’ve also had the chance to teach sec­ondary school stu­dents the basics of com­puter-aided de­sign.</p>

    <p>CHAL­LENG­ING TIMES</p>
    <p>My em­ployer told me that I had to ac­cept the new ar­range­ment or I would be let go. I had to agree as it’s so chal­leng­ing to find another job in this pan­demic, and hav­ing a trainee­ship is bet­ter than hav­ing noth­ing at all.</p>
