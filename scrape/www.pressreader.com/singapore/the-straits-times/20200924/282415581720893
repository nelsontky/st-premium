    <p>• West Ham man­ager David Moyes and play­ers Issa Diop and Josh Cullen all tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 just be­fore the English Pre­mier League club’s 5-1 thrash­ing of third-tier out­fit Hull City in the League Cup on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Ham­mers’ med­i­cal team were in­formed of the test re­sults while Moyes and his squad were at the London Sta­dium pre­par­ing for the third-round tie. French de­fender Diop and Ire­land mid­fielder Cullen, who were in the squad, had to with­draw from the start­ing lineup.</p>
    <p>“The man­ager and both play­ers im­me­di­ately left the sta­dium and re­turned home,” a West Ham state­ment said. “All three, who are asymp­to­matic, will now fol­low Pub­lic Health Eng­land and Pre­mier League guide­lines and pro­to­cols.”</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s match went ahead as planned, with Ham­mers as­sis­tant man­ager Alan Irvine tak­ing charge of the team.</p>
    <p>French striker Se­bastien Haller and Ukraine winger An­driy Yar­molenko both scored a dou­ble, while Scot­land winger Robert Sn­od­grass was also on tar­get, lead­ing Irvine to praise the team’s men­tal strength.</p>
    <p>He said: “There were no play­ers</p>
    <p>dis­cussing it or look­ing for ex­cuses about what was go­ing on. No play­ers were think­ing that the game couldn’t go on, it was all pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“It was vi­tally im­por­tant that the play­ers were pre­pared psy­cho­log­i­cally and ready to go out and per­form. This was an op­por­tu­nity for them to im­press and they cer­tainly did that.</p>
    <p>“I am not wor­ried, the mood af­ter the game was one of ex­cite­ment,</p>
    <p>they know they played well and did them­selves a load of good go­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>The Ham­mers also in­sisted their coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols re­main strin­gent and con­firmed that Moyes, Diop and Cullen will have to self­iso­late for 10 days, mean­ing they will miss Sun­day’s match at home to Wolves and the fourth round of the League Cup next week.</p>

    <p>nal have re­turned no pos­i­tive tests af­ter fac­ing the Ham­mers in the top flight last Satur­day and will con­tinue their fix­tures as planned.</p>
    <p>The three pos­i­tive tests came just hours af­ter Tot­ten­ham’s League Cup tie at Ley­ton Ori­ent was post­poned to an as-yet-un­con­firmed date af­ter sev­eral mem­bers of the fourth-tier side tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
