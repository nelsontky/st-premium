    <p>• Dave Prowse, the Bri­tish ac­tor be­hind the men­ac­ing black mask of Star Wars vil­lain Darth Vader, has died, his agent Thomas Bow­ing­ton said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s with great sad­ness that we have to an­nounce that our client Dave Prowse... passed away yes­ter­day morn­ing at the age of 85,” Mr Bow­ing­ton wrote on Face­book.</p>
    <p>“May the force be with him, al­ways,” the agent told the BBC.</p>
    <p>Mr Bow­ing­ton added that Prowse’s death was “a truly and deeply heart-wrench­ing loss for us and mil­lions of fans all over the world”.</p>
    <p>A for­mer body­builder-turnedac­tor, Prowse’s tow­er­ing stature at al­most 2m clinched him the role of the in­stantly recog­nis­able an­tag­o­nist i n the orig­i­nal Star Wars tril­ogy (1977 to 1983).</p>
    <p>But while he donned the glossy black ar­mour and cape, the Bris­tol na­tive’s strong western English ac­cent meant the film-mak­ers turned to ac­tor James Earl Jones for the chill­ing voice that would emerge from be­hind the mask.</p>
    <p>Prowse, nev­er­the­less, re­mained at­tached to the char­ac­ter, telling Agence France-Presse in 2013 that he was “the great­est big-screen vil­lain of all time”.</p>
    <p>Since the re­lease of the orig­i­nal Star Wars tril­ogy, he had trav­elled the world meet­ing hard­core fans.</p>
    <p>Even though he was fa­mous for play­ing the role of Darth Vader, he said he was most proud of play­ing the Green Cross Code Man, which earned him an Or­der of the Bri­tish Em­pire for pro­mot­ing road safety in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Mark Hamill, who played Darth Vader’s son Luke Sky­walker in the Star Wars film se­ries, has paid trib­ute to Prowse on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Hamill, 69, wrote: “So sad to hear David Prowse has passed. He was a kind man & much more than Darth Vader... He loved his fans as much as they loved him.”</p>
    <p>Prowse left be­hind his wife Norma Scam­mell and three chil­dren.</p>
