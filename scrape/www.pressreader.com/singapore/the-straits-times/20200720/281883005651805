    <p>BRUS­SELS • An EU sum­mit to seek agree­ment on a huge coro­n­avirus eco­nomic res­cue pack­age could col­lapse with­out a deal, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel warned yes­ter­day, as bick­er­ing lead­ers be­gan a third day of talks.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers of the 27 mem­ber states have ar­gued for two days over the scale and rules for the pack­age, with the Nether­lands lead­ing a band of “fru­gal” al­lies in de­mand­ing lower bud­gets and tougher con­di­tions for hand­outs.</p>
    <p>Ar­riv­ing for what she said was prob­a­bly the “de­ci­sive” day of the ex­tra­or­di­nary sum­mit, Dr Merkel said there were still many di­vi­sions among the lead­ers, adding: “I still can’t say whether a solution will be found. There is a lot of good­will... but it may also be that no re­sult will be achieved to­day.”</p>
    <p>The vet­eran Ger­man leader joined French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and the sum­mit host, Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel, to pre­pare a new of­fer to break the log­jam after Dutch Prime Min­is­ter Mark Rutte and his “Fru­gal Five” al­lies blocked a deal.</p>
    <p>The Dutch want mem­ber states to have a say over na­tional bailouts and en­sure coun­tries carry out labour mar­ket re­forms, while Aus­tria, Fin­land, Den­mark and Swe­den want to see the up to €750-bil­lion(S$1.2 tril­lion) pack­age of loans and sub­si­dies cut down.</p>
    <p>The “fru­gals” have re­sisted the pleas of Ger­many and France, tra­di­tion­ally the bloc’s most pow­er­ful mem­bers, to agree on a plan to lift the coun­tries hard­est hit by the pan­demic – no­tably Spain and Italy.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron urged lead­ers to “take re­spon­si­bil­ity” as Europe grap­ples with a se­vere re­ces­sion caused by the virus and its lock­downs, say­ing a deal could still be found.</p>
    <p>“But these com­pro­mises can­not be made at the cost of Euro­pean am­bi­tion,” he warned.</p>
    <p>“Not out of prin­ci­ple but be­cause we are fac­ing an un­prece­dented health, eco­nomic and so­cial cri­sis, be­cause our coun­tries need it and Euro­pean unity needs it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Michel was forced to work through the night to draw up a com­pro­mise that could be sat­is­fac­tory to all when the lead­ers re­con­vened in a plenary ses­sion at noon (6pm Sin­ga­pore time) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A French diplo­matic source said Mr Macron and Dr Merkel re­fused pres­sure by Mr Rutte and his al­lies to cut the grants in the scheme to be­low €400 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers are try­ing to ap­prove a plan that could quickly send EU cash to coun­tries hit the hard­est by the coro­n­avirus, most no­tably Spain and Italy.</p>
    <p>The Nether­lands re­fused ear­lier ver­sions of Mr Michel’s plan be­cause they gave away too much cash as grants, in­stead of loans.</p>
    <p>Mr Rutte is also wary about the plan’s gov­er­nance and in­sists that na­tional gov­ern­ments get a veto on the spend­ing plans of gov­ern­ments re­ceiv­ing cash from the Brus­sels pack­age.</p>
    <p>Un­der­ly­ing his con­cern is the rep­u­ta­tion of Spain and Italy for lax pub­lic spend­ing in the minds of vot­ers in north­ern Europe, and Mr Rutte wants them to re­form their labour and pen­sions rules.</p>
    <p>“We’re in a stale­mate, it’s very com­pli­cated, more com­pli­cated than ex­pected,” Ital­ian Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte said.</p>
    <p>In a con­ces­sion to Mr Rutte’s de­mands, Mr Michel pro­posed a “su­per emer­gency brake” that gives any coun­try a three-day win­dow to trig­ger a re­view by all mem­ber states of an­other’s spend­ing plans.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Mr Michel pro­posed keep­ing the to­tal re­cov­ery bud­get at €750 mil­lion but shift­ing the bal­ance from grants to loans, which rise from €250 mil­lion to €300 mil­lion, a doc­u­ment seen by AFP shows. To fur­ther en­tice the “fru­gals”, Mr Michel promised to hike the re­bates they get on their EU con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers are try­ing to ap­prove a plan that could quickly send EU cash to coun­tries hit the hard­est by coro­n­avirus, no­tably Spain and Italy.</p>
    <p>The Nether­lands re­fused ear­lier ver­sions of Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel’s plan be­cause they gave away too much cash as grants, in­stead of loans.</p>
