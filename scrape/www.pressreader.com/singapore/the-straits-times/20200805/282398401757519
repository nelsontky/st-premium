    <p>The Sony A8H 4K Oled TV is a flag­ship tele­vi­sion set in all but name. While it may not be the des­ig­nated suc­ces­sor to last year’s A9G flag­ship model – which is still avail­able in stores – the A8H uses the same X1 Ul­ti­mate processor as the A9G.</p>
    <p>This means all the fancy-sound­ing fea­tures of the A9G that af­fect its im­age pro­cess­ing, up­scal­ing per­for­mance and mo­tion han­dling are also avail­able on the A8H.</p>
    <p>In fact, the only ma­jor ad­van­tage of the A9G over the A8H is prob­a­bly its su­pe­rior TV speak­ers, though the price dif­fer­ence be­tween them – the 55-inch A8H is $4,599 and the A9G $7,999 – can eas­ily get you a top-notch sound sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Sony con­tin­ues to fid­dle with the TV stand’s de­sign. The A9G’s base stand, which re­placed its pre­de­ces­sor’s easel stand, has given way to a pair of metal feet that barely raises the TV above the con­sole. For those with a sound­bar, the feet can be ad­justed so the screen is not blocked by the sound­bar. The feet also help with ca­ble man­age­ment – rout­ing wires through the feet hides them from view.</p>
    <p>The TV it­self con­sists of an ul­tra­thin Oled panel with a thicker but flat plas­tic chas­sis, which houses the ports and in­ter­nal elec­tron­ics, that is grafted on the lower back. Over­all, the A8H looks el­e­gant with­out any ex­tra­ne­ous el­e­ments to dis­tract from its ex­cel­lent screen.</p>
    <p>Like many of Sony’s re­cent premium TVs, the A8H uses ac­tu­a­tors to vi­brate the screen such that the au­dio seems to come di­rectly from the screen. These speak­ers can get very loud, though the power out­put is half that of the A9G’s. The bass is also not as good as that of a stand­alone sub­woofer.</p>
    <p>To my dis­ap­point­ment, the A8H’s four HDMI ports do not sup­port the lat­est HDMI 2.1 stan­dard and hence lacks gam­ing-cen­tric fea­tures such as vari­able re­fresh rate and auto l ow la­tency mode. It seems like a ma­jor omis­sion see­ing as these fea­tures would have been sup­ported on the up­com­ing Sony PlayS­ta­tion 5 con­sole.</p>
    <p>The A8H does have the En­hanced Au­dio Re­turn Chan­nel fea­ture on one of its HDMI ports, which al­lows full-res­o­lu­tion au­dio such as Dolby At­mos to pass be­tween TV and sound­bar. High dy­namic range (HDR) video for­mats such as Dolby Vi­sion, HDR10 and HLG for­mats are sup­ported, though not the HDR10+ for­mat cham­pi­oned by Samsung.</p>
    <p>The built-in Net­flix app offers a Net­flix Calibrated mode that claims to dis­play videos as they were in­tended by con­tent cre­ators to be viewed. How­ever, I find this mode to be not as vi­brant as the TV’s Cin­ema or Dolby Vi­sion modes.</p>
    <p>Also in­cluded in the TV out of the box are the Ama­zon Prime Video and YouTube apps. As the A8H runs on the An­droid TV plat­form, you can in­stall TV-op­ti­mised ver­sions of An­droid apps such as Spo­tify and Twitch from Google Play Store.</p>
    <p>This An­droid TV im­ple­men­ta­tion is Sony’s most pol­ished ef­fort yet. It does not freeze oc­ca­sion­ally like with older Sony An­droid TVs. Sony has also added short, help­ful ex­plain­ers for its TV set­tings.</p>
    <p>Un­like re­cent TVs from LG and Samsung, the A8H does not have an Ap­ple TV app. Ap­ple AirPlay 2 is sup­ported, though, so you can stream con­tent from an Ap­ple de­vice.</p>
    <p>The A8H’s pic­ture qual­ity is ex­quis­ite. The screen looks uni­form with­out any band­ing or splotches in the 4K Blu-ray ver­sion of Blade Run­ner 2049.</p>
    <p>Images ap­pear nat­u­ral, re­al­is­tic and not too vivid. The mo­tion pro­cess­ing is re­strained – I no­tice it be­ing overly smooth and ar­ti­fi­cial only at the higher set­tings.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the only crit­i­cism of the A8H is that, like re­cent Oled TVs, it is not as bright as LED TVs or even older Oled mod­els. But I find the bright­ness level more than ac­cept­able when watch­ing movies with the lights switched on.</p>
    <p>The TV’s up­scal­ing per­for­mance is ex­cel­lent too. While DVD movies (at 480p res­o­lu­tion) still have a soft, grainy look, they ap­pear smoother with less noise than other TVs I have tested. Mean­while, 1,080p Blu-ray movies are al­most as sharp as the 4K ver­sions.</p>
    <p>At $4,599 for the 55-inch ver­sion, the A8H is priced to com­pete with LG’s lat­est CX Oled TV (from $4,099). In fact, the prices for both TVs con­verge at $5,999 for the 65-inch model.</p>
    <p>The Sony prob­a­bly edges it for me in the pic­ture qual­ity de­part­ment and the wide range of apps for the An­droid TV plat­form. But the LG CX is the bet­ter op­tion for gamers who in­tend to buy a nextgen­er­a­tion con­sole.</p>
