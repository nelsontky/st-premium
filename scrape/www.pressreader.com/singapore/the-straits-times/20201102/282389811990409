    <p>The United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is just around the corner and if the polls are right, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den is set to take con­trol of the White House for the next four years. Our pol­icy team sees a 55 per cent chance that Democrats com­plete a full sweep of both branches of Con­gress and the pres­i­dency, ver­sus just a 28 per cent chance of Repub­li­cans hold­ing on to the Se­nate and White House.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Bi­den would look very dif­fer­ent from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. Be­sides their so­cial me­dia habits, the two share very lit­tle in com­mon in terms of their pol­icy stances and world views.</p>
    <p>One favours mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, the other uni­lat­er­al­ism; one wants to raise cor­po­rate taxes, the other wants to keep them low; one hopes to build a green econ­omy, the other sup­ports a fos­sil fuel-run one.</p>
    <p>Asia is a trade-ori­ented bloc that is much im­pacted by US-China ten­sions. A po­ten­tial lead­er­ship change in the White House would have sig­nif­i­cant ram­i­fi­ca­tions for the re­gion.</p>
    <p>WHAT A BI­DEN PRES­I­DENCY WOULD LOOK LIKE</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 cases surg­ing and busi­nesses suf­fer­ing, the US is in des­per­ate need of stim­u­lus. The Democrats want an out­sized Bill that – among other forms of aid – sends new stim­u­lus cheques to ci­ti­zens, while the Repub­li­cans want a leaner one that cov­ers only un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits and li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tion for en­ter­prises. Both sides have dug in for now and are not will­ing to com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>If Democrats surge to power in a blue wave and gain a strong enough foothold in the Se­nate, they could se­cure the 60 votes needed to ad­vance their fis­cal plan; like­wise, a red wave would make the Repub­li­can plan more likely.</p>
    <p>The Bill’s pas­sage – whether it is writ­ten by Repub­li­cans or Democrats – would be a sig­nif­i­cant tail­wind for the econ­omy that fans de­mand from con­sumers and busi­nesses, and eq­uity mar­kets are likely to re­act favourably. And what is good for the world’s big­gest econ­omy is good for Asia’s, as the growth would trickle in to the re­gion’s ex­porters.</p>
    <p>A blue wave would also usher in a new era of US en­vi­ron­men­tal lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s cli­mate and en­vi­ron­men­tal jus­tice pro­posal pledges to make a fed­eral in­vest­ment of US$1.7 tril­lion</p>
    <p>(S$2.3 tril­lion) over the next 10 years in ar­eas like clean en­ergy and in­fra­struc­ture, lev­er­ag­ing ad­di­tional pri­vate sec­tor, state and lo­cal in­vest­ments to to­tal more than US$5 tril­lion. This would be a wind­fall for firms lead­ing in the devel­op­ment of eco-friendly tech­nolo­gies, such as Ja­panese au­tomak­ers and Chi­nese so­lar man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>On the down­side for mar­kets, Mr Bi­den’s tax plan would see mean­ing­ful raises for cor­po­ra­tions once post-elec­tion fis­cal spend­ing puts the eco­nomic re­cov­ery on a firmer foot­ing.</p>
    <p>Democrats also seek tighter reg­u­la­tions on in­dus­tries like en­ergy. Such mea­sures could dampen in­vest­ment and spend­ing, but the eco­nomic drag should be more than off­set by the fis­cal boost and the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s fo­cus on in­fra­struc­ture, green ini­tia­tives and po­ten­tially health­care cov­er­age ex­pan­sion – spend­ing that could ex­ceed US$4 tril­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>THE ELE­PHANT IN THE ROOM – CHINA</p>
    <p>For Asia, all eyes are on China. Re­la­tions be­tween China and the US are at their low­est point in decades, and coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore are forced to tightrope-walk be­tween the two eco­nomic pow­er­houses. This bal­anc­ing act will con­tinue re­gard­less of who wins the White House, but US pol­icy would likely be more pre­dictable and prag­matic with Mr Bi­den in power.</p>
    <p>The long-time politi­cian’s in­cli­na­tion to use diplo­macy over tar­iffs as a tool to ex­act his for­eign pol­icy goals would cre­ate a more cer­tain en­vi­ron­ment, giv­ing firms and in­vestors more clar­ity about the fu­ture. Pres­sure would still be heaped on China, but it would likely be more tar­geted at spe­cific is­sues such as hu­man rights, and less im­pact­ful to the broader re­gion. Mr Bi­den also re­port­edly plans to en­list al­lies to sway</p>
    <p>Beijing, in­stead of go­ing at it alone.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship cer­tainly would not be a happy one, but it would be less volatile than it is now. In fact, while com­pe­ti­tion and con­fronta­tion will con­tinue, a re­turn to eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion where mu­tual in­ter­ests pre­vail is also pos­si­ble. Mr Bi­den’s green ini­tia­tives would likely re­quire man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­port from Chi­nese firms. Even tech­nol­ogy may see some ar­eas of im­proved co­op­er­a­tion, such as in cy­ber se­cu­rity, or at least less hos­til­ity. This is good news for Asia’s IT sup­ply chain and es­pe­cially Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firms, which are set to en­joy strong sup­port from Beijing for a long time.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the ex­pe­ri­ence of the past four years has con­vinced the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment to speed up var­i­ous mar­ket re­forms. Beijing’s up­com­ing 14th Five-Year Plan is ex­pected to fo­cus on four ma­jor themes: the “dual-cir­cu­la­tion” strat­egy led by do­mes­tic de­mand, tech self-suf­fi­ciency, ur­ban­i­sa­tion 2.0 and the green econ­omy. The pri­or­i­ties set forth are am­bi­tious, and achiev­ing them will re­quire ro­bust in­vest­ment and pol­icy sup­port. Asian com­pa­nies lev­er­ag­ing th­ese trends should ben­e­fit from Beijing’s help­ing hand.</p>
    <p>STAY IN­VESTED RE­GARD­LESS OF ELEC­TION OUT­COME</p>
    <p>Eq­uity mar­kets have been jit­tery of late. But, re­gard­less of the out­come of the US elec­tion, in­vestors should stay in the mar­ket and po­si­tion for po­ten­tial eq­uity up­side ahead.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines are likely to be widely ad­min­is­tered from the mid­dle of next year, prompt­ing mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions to be eased in many coun­tries. This should cause earn­ings to re­bound glob­ally and the eco­nomic re­cov­ery to broaden out.</p>
    <p>Lag­ging eq­uity mar­kets in Sin­ga­pore, Bri­tain, and the small/mid-cap seg­ments in the US and Europe should catch up in the year ahead, as cycli­cal sec­tors ben­e­fit from the greater nor­mal­i­sa­tion of pri­vate life.</p>
    <p>The risk of a con­tested elec­tion out­come is not in­signif­i­cant, how­ever. Un­like past elec­tions, the re­sults may not be known im­me­di­ately be­cause of the wide­spread use of mail-in vot­ing; only eight states ex­pect to have at least 98 per cent of un­of­fi­cial re­sults re­ported by noon the day af­ter the elec­tion, ac­cord­ing to The New York Times. The mar­kets will not re­spond pos­i­tively to an un­known re­sult, or a dis­puted one. In the case of the con­tested 2000 elec­tion, there was a gap of 36 days, dur­ing which the S&P 500 fell 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The stakes have never been higher for a US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, but for in­vestors, the strat­egy re­mains the same – stay in­vested and di­ver­sify across sec­tors, re­gions and as­sets.</p>
