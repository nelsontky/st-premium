    <p>Ms Me­lati Hashim al­lo­cates about RM20,000 (S$6,550) a year for overseas hol­i­days, but the travel re­stric­tions due to the Covid-19 pan­demic have seen her splurge in other ways.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old in­sur­ance agent now buys things she would never have con­sid­ered be­fore, as a con­so­la­tion for not be­ing able to travel.</p>
    <p>“I use the money to buy things I nor­mally find ‘waste­ful’. The most ridicu­lous thing I’ve bought so far is a hairstyler, which cost RM2,100, and some make-up,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I thought of get­ting a new car too, since mine is su­per old, but that would mean hav­ing to com­mit to a five- or seven-year hire pur­chase loan.</p>
    <p>“So I de­cided to just dine at some of the restau­rants I’ve al­ways wanted to try, and also got my­self a brand-new iPhone 11 Pro Max to re­place my seven-year-old phone.”</p>
    <p>Malaysians’ love for travel has seen both out­bound and do­mes­tic tourism grow steadily over the years.</p>
    <p>Last year, res­i­dents here spent RM44.8 bil­lion on hol­i­days abroad, com­pared with RM31.1 bil­lion in 2015.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic tourism ex­pen­di­ture was RM92.6 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­mains in the re­cov­ery phase of its move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) un­til Dec 31, dur­ing which so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties have been mostly al­lowed to re­sume, with safe mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Al­though in­ter­state travel in Malaysia has been al­lowed since June 10, many hol­i­day­mak­ers re­main wary of trav­el­ling amid a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s bor­ders have been shut to in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers since March, and those al­lowed to fly into the coun­try must un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Un­able to scratch their travel itch, would-be hol­i­day­mak­ers have dipped into their travel funds to in­dulge var­i­ous whims.</p>
    <p>They have bought any­thing from por­ta­ble swim­ming pools and pic­nic tarps for out­door ac­tiv­i­ties with chil­dren, to fancy be­jew­elled face masks and ex­trav­a­gant ob­jects like an 18K gold book­mark.</p>
    <p>Free­lance writer and avid trav­eller Ha­jar Hakim splurged on en­ter­tain­ment and lo­cal hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“I bought things dur­ing the MCO that I would not have bought oth­er­wise,” said the 42-year-old moth­erof-two.</p>
    <p>“I bought a Nin­tendo Switch for the kids, and I just bought an An­droid pro­jec­tor for my son be­cause I don’t want him to watch Net­flix or YouTube on the phone, tablet or tele­vi­sion as I heard the pro­jec­tor is bet­ter for the eyes.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I also bought a deep freezer, pres­sure cooker and steam­boat grill.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank said Malaysians spent RM10.2 bil­lion do­mes­ti­cally via credit card in July, nearly dou­ble from RM5.3 bil­lion in April.</p>
    <p>This also shows that the level of credit card spend­ing has re­turned to al­most the same level last year.</p>
    <p>Car sales were up in July by 1.7 per cent year on year, show­ing a re­bound from June’s 4.5 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>Pero­dua re­ported 23,203 cars sold in July – triple its May sales – while Pro­ton’s July sales fig­ure was the high­est in eight years.</p>
    <p>Both lo­cal brands are the most pop­u­lar car makes in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Asked if she sees her­self rechan­nelling her ex­pen­di­ture to travel, Ms Me­lati said: “I ac­tu­ally pre­fer to splurge on hol­i­days than shop­ping, but since there’s no sign that Covid-19 is go­ing away any time soon, maybe I’d just con­tinue to treat my­self like this.”</p>
