    <p>Hawk­ers and neigh­bour­hood en­ter­prises will get a help­ing hand to boost their busi­nesses, thanks to a col­lab­o­ra­tion between the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ Chi­nese Media Group (CMG) and two busi­ness as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions, Sin­ga­pore (FMAS), its sub­sidiary Heart­land En­ter­prise Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore (HECS) and the Chi­nese Media Group have signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing to pro­mote heart­land busi­nesses and help them dig­i­talise.</p>
    <p>An­nounced – and start­ing – yes­ter­day, the col­lab­o­ra­tion of the three par­ties will see them run projects un­til the end of the year.</p>
    <p>To drive foot­fall to the heart­land, CMG will pro­mote heart­land tours cu­rated by HECS on its media plat­forms, in­clud­ing Lianhe Zaobao, Lianhe Wan­bao and Shin Min Daily News, as well as on Zaobao.sg and the Chi­nese ra­dio sta­tions, UFM100.3 and 96.3 Hao FM.</p>
    <p>The three or­gan­i­sa­tions will also or­gan­ise heart­land en­ter­prise sem­i­nars and work­shops to pro­mote aware­ness about and adop­tion of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion among Hous­ing Board shop own­ers and hawk­ers. “These sem­i­nars will pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on best prac­tices and avail­able as­sis­tance schemes to help heart­land busi­nesses re­main com­pet­i­tive,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, CMG will also or­gan­ise sem­i­nars and awards that high­light suc­cess sto­ries of en­ter­prises and hawk­ers who have dig­i­talised their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>FMAS pres­i­dent Yeo Hiang Meng said he hoped the col­lab­o­ra­tion will al­low the as­so­ci­a­tion to reach out to busi­nesses own­ers and “look at var­i­ous is­sues that af­fect their sur­viv­abil­ity, such as busi­ness suc­ces­sion and trans­for­ma­tion of (their) busi­ness model”.</p>
    <p>“We also hope this will al­low CMG’s vast read­er­ship to have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of our rich mul­ti­fac­eted com­mu­nity and food cul­ture,” he added.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that neigh­bour­hood mer­chants are “an in­te­gral part of Sin­ga­pore­ans’ daily lives and are crit­i­cal contributo­rs to the econ­omy”, CMG head Lee Huay Leng said: “We look for­ward to lever­ag­ing our net­work to as­sist the heart­land en­ter­prises and hawk­ers to keep their busi­nesses and neigh­bour­hoods vi­brant and thriv­ing.”</p>
