    <p>Some roles per­formed by hu­man re­source (HR) man­agers are at risk of be­ing taken over by ro­bots in the near fu­ture, a study com­mis­sioned by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als (IHRP) has found.</p>
    <p>Of the 27 HR roles an­a­lysed, 24 will be af­fected by tech­nol­ogy to vary­ing de­grees in the next three to five years, ac­cord­ing to the study con­ducted by ad­vi­sory, broking and so­lu­tions firm Wil­lis Tow­ers Wat­son. The re­sults of the study were re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Eight of the roles most se­verely af­fected and at risk of be­ing re­placed are lower-level po­si­tions in areas such as tal­ent man­age­ment, per­for­mance and re­wards, as well as or­gan­i­sa­tion devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The tasks in these roles are ad­min­is­tra­tive in na­ture and can be au­to­mated with ad­vances in ro­botic process au­to­ma­tion, ma­chine learn­ing and so­cial ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>Six­teen jobs, which are at the man­age­rial and head lev­els, will be aug­mented by tech­nol­ogy and re­quire skills in areas such as data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Only three jobs will see min­i­mal im­pact from au­to­ma­tion: head of tal­ent man­age­ment, HR busi­ness part­ner and man­ager of or­gan­i­sa­tion devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments will lead to the cre­ation of new roles in HR that are highly spe­cialised, such as that of an HR data an­a­lyst, the study found.</p>
    <p>“In the long term, peo­ple an­a­lyt­ics will be a key skill re­quired by all roles in HR rather than be­ing a ded­i­cated role,” said Wil­lis Tow­ers Wat­son in its report.</p>
    <p>There are about 48,000 HR pro­fes­sion­als in Sin­ga­pore, with more than 90 per cent of them in pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian roles.</p>
    <p>The firm said the study high­lights the need for HR to rein­vent it­self by driv­ing busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>It added that lead­ers in the field must also recog­nise the need for new ca­pa­bil­i­ties in HR, such as pre­dic­tive an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in and adopt­ing tech­nol­ogy will in­crease ef­fi­ciency and al­low HR to de­liver seam­less and cut­ting-edge ser­vices and ex­pe­ri­ences more ef­fec­tively, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad yes­ter­day at the Peo­ple Be­hind Peo­ple Fo­rum, where he an­nounced the study’s find­ings.</p>
    <p>He said MOM will con­tinue to sup­port busi­nesses in strength­en­ing their HR ca­pa­bil­i­ties and help­ing HR pro­fes­sion­als gain new skills to re­main rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>IHRP is also de­vel­op­ing train­ing cour­ses for HR pro­fes­sion­als to pick up skills to pre­pare for the dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who also spoke at the fo­rum, said HR pro­fes­sion­als have been the un­seen he­roes in keep­ing work­ers safe and or­gan­i­sa­tions go­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said HR pro­fes­sion­als will have an even more im­por­tant role to play, as the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy urged busi­nesses and</p>
    <p>HR lead­ers to in­vest in tech­nol­ogy and sup­port skills devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“HR pro­fes­sion­als, too, need to step up and take own­er­ship of their own skills devel­op­ment and adopt a growth mind­set in em­brac­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion,” he said.</p>
