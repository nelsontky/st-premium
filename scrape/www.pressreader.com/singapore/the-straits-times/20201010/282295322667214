    <p>Live sport re­turned to the Re­pub­lic last night when mixed mar­tial arts or­gan­i­sa­tion One Cham­pi­onship held its Reign of Dy­nas­ties event at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>But it was not ex­actly a re­turn to nor­mal. Be­cause of strict mea­sures by the Gov­ern­ment to en­sure the safety of all par­tic­i­pants in­volved, the show was a closed-door event – just like One’s last show in Sin­ga­pore in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Reign of Dy­nas­ties was in­stead streamed on all of One’s dig­i­tal plat­forms, such as its mo­bile phone app and YouTube chan­nel.</p>
    <p>Apart from the ath­letes, only staff whose phys­i­cal pres­ence were ab­so­lutely cru­cial to the pro­duc­tion of the event were al­lowed in the In­door Sta­dium. Even com­men­ta­tors Michael Schi­avello and Mitch Chil­son lent their voices to the show re­motely, from Aus­tralia and the Philip­pines re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The ath­letes were all whisked back to their “bub­ble” at the Shangri-La Ho­tel soon af­ter each of their fights.</p>
    <p>One did ev­ery­thing to en­sure the pageantry re­mained, such as fight­ers do­ing their tra­di­tional walk out down a ramp to the cage, ac­com­pa­nied by blar­ing mu­sic and video pack­ages.</p>
    <p>One events in Sin­ga­pore typ­i­cally draw crowds of around 6,000 to the in­door arena, which has a ca­pac­ity of about 12,000.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ab­sence of fans, the ath­letes served up a treat. Roshan Mainam and Liu Peng Shuai set the tone with an ex­cit­ing first match, in which In­dian fighter Mainam won with a rear-naked choke sub­mis­sion in the sec­ond round.</p>
    <p>In all, only one of the six bouts on the card lasted the dis­tance.</p>
    <p>The five that did not in­cluded an emo­tional win for Sin­ga­pore’s Amir Khan, who knocked out In­dia’s Rahul Raju in the first round.</p>
    <p>Amir’s 61-year-old father Ta­judeen An­sari was di­ag­nosed with stage four brain can­cer in Au­gust, and was told by doc­tors he had up to six months to live.</p>
    <p>In a tele­phone call, Amir told The Straits Times: “My dad has been in my cor­ner from day one, and even though he’s not phys­i­cally well and can barely walk right now, he has been there for me the whole fight week… I wish I can be half the man he is.”</p>
    <p>In the main event, Thai vet­eran Sam-A Gaiyang­hadao re­tained his One Cham­pi­onship strawweigh­t muay thai world ti­tle with a sec­ond-round tech­ni­cal knock­out over Aus­tralia’s Josh Tonna.</p>
    <p>One group pres­i­dent Teh Hua Fung called the event a “smash­ing suc­cess”. “It feels great to be in Sin­ga­pore, show­cas­ing our mar­tial arts he­roes again in our home coun­try,” he added. “On the health and safety front, we put to­gether very strin­gent pro­to­cols... I am happy to report that so far ev­ery­thing has been smooth, and more tests will be done be­fore send­ing our ath­letes back home.”</p>
