    <p>The Straits Times has launched a dig­i­tal pro­mo­tional deal for the in­di­vid­ual reader, with its lat­est sub­scrip­tion of­fer part of the ST re­vamp.</p>
    <p>Pay­ing just $9.90 each month for the One Dig­i­tal sub­scrip­tion pack­age, sub­scribers can keep up with cur­rent af­fairs amid the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>The no-frills pack­age lets read­ers log in to ac­cess all of ST’s con­tent via one Web browser and one app at the same time. Com­plete with a new look, the re­freshed web­site show­cases mul­ti­me­dia con­tent and trend­ing top­ics.</p>
    <p>The One Dig­i­tal pack­age does not come with a con­tract.</p>
    <p>Those who pre­fer the look of a print news­pa­per can ac­cess the epa­per. A two-week ar­chive lets read­ers catch up on news they missed.</p>
    <p>“With the in­tro­duc­tion of the ST One Dig­i­tal pro­mo­tional pack­age, we hope to pro­vide on-the-go read­ers with a fuss-free sub­scrip­tion op­tion that gives them just the right ac­cess they need, at an af­ford­able price,” said Mr Eric Ng, deputy head of the cir­cu­la­tion divi­sion at Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>One of the ear­li­est sub­scribers to the of­fer launched on Nov 17, Ms Miti Garg, an as­so­ci­ate lec­turer at PSB Academy, said it helps her keep abreast of her in­ter­ests in en­trepreneur­ship and prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Though Ms Garg, 47, ended her sub­scrip­tion to ST in July, she was at­tracted to the more “cost-ef­fec­tive” new of­fer. “In­stead of hav­ing news­pa­pers col­lect dust in a cor­ner, I now have an en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly and pocket-friendly way of read­ing the news in a dig­i­tal for­mat,” she added.</p>
    <p>She is now able to en­joy an In­vest sec­tion that was re­freshed in ST’s re­vamp be­gin­ning on Oct 15, with a fo­cus on jobs and the usual per­sonal finance tips.</p>
    <p>Read­ers can also re­ceive in­vest­ment tips through the In­vest newslet­ter, and se­lected episodes of daily talk show The Big Story.</p>
    <p>The re­freshed ST app has a new Dis­cover sec­tion that fea­tures short vis­ual sto­ries op­ti­mised for mo­bile de­vices.</p>
    <p>A new News Fo­cus sec­tion on Satur­days con­tains long reads in Asian In­sider, where ST’s over­seas bu­reaus an­a­lyse the big re­gional sto­ries, and In­sight, which looks at is­sues that af­fect Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The re­vamped Sun­day Times has a new Views seg­ment fea­tur­ing pieces by vet­eran ST jour­nal­ists as well as younger voices and mil­len­ni­als in the news­room.</p>
    <p>An­other reader, Mr Ong Jun Jie, 40, said the new pack­age met his pref­er­ence for read­ing the e-paper.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­ual fo­cus of the prod­uct was also timely as it saved him the has­sle of hav­ing to find in­di­vid­u­als to share a sub­scrip­tion with.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been read­ing ST since my school­ing days. I like it for its coverage of world events with an Asian lens,” said the mar­ket­ing pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>Read­ers can sub­scribe to the ST One Dig­i­tal pack­age at this link: stsub.sg/one</p>
