    <p>• Late at night, Mr Lalo Lopez heads to a small Shang­hai stu­dio for a live-stream, punt­ing Chi­nese prod­ucts from cy­cling shorts to vac­uum clean­ers to Span­ish speak­ers around the world.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old Spa­niard, who calls him­self an artist, DJ and YouTu­ber, is in the van­guard of the grow­ing ranks of for­eign­ers hired by main­land agen­cies to ex­tend China’s live-stream sales ma­nia beyond its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>By some es­ti­mates, live-stream shop­ping is a near US$70 bil­lion (S$93.6 bil­lion) in­dus­try in China, at­tract­ing in­flu­encers who scour mar­kets and malls for items to ped­dle to live au­di­ences on­line.</p>
    <p>Once an ob­scure form of shop­ping, live-stream­ing is pre­dicted to change the habits of global con­sumers, whose foot­fall has al­ready headed from the high street to on­line mar­ket­places.</p>
    <p>Buoyed by the suc­cess of livestream­s at home, Chi­nese firms crave bridge­heads for their goods over­seas. En­ter hosts such as Mr Lopez, who has lived in China for about nine years and was ap­proached by Bei­jing-based mar­ket­ing firm Linkone In­ter­ac­tive after it saw videos he posted on YouTube and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“When I speak, I look at the prod­uct through my cul­ture, through my ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Mr Lopez,</p>
    <p>whose streams can at­tract up to 15,000 view­ers.</p>
    <p>The medium al­lows him to an­swer view­ers’ ques­tions on ev­ery­thing from cloth­ing and house­hold ap­pli­ances to gad­gets in real-time, while en­ter­tain­ing them with trivia and flam­boy­ant sales pat­ter.</p>
    <p>“It’s eas­ier (for me) be­cause of the cul­tural back­ground we share,” said Mr Lopez, who earns up to 1,500 yuan per ses­sion, re­fer­ring to his for­eign cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The pi­o­neer­ing live-stream­ers are a di­verse mix, with Pol­ish speak­ers sell­ing eye mas­sagers and</p>
    <p>Ital­ian speak­ers flog­ging light­ing for self­ies.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese agen­cies are train­ing for­eign hosts in China and re­cruit­ing in­flu­encers abroad, in hopes of hook­ing onto a win­ning pat­tern.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Zhiguo, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Linkone In­ter­ac­tive, said his firm has been train­ing non-Chi­nese live-stream­ing hosts for nearly two years, as brands look to ex­pand abroad. It has about 50 in­flu­encers tar­get­ing mar­kets such as the US, France and Spain.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try has taken off since 2016, when on­line giants Taobao and JD.com both launched livestream­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>This year, it could gross more than 1 tril­lion yuan (S$204 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to a re­port by KPMG and AliRe­search, an arm of e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba. That would more than dou­ble the 2019 numbers es­ti­mated by Shang­hai-based firm iRe­search of US$68 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Last year, there might only have been sev­eral hun­dred (view­ers),” Mr Zhang said. But now, “it’s nor­mal to get sev­eral thou­sand views”.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess in China may have in­spired oth­ers to en­ter the livestream scram­ble for cus­tomers. US gi­ant Ama­zon launched Ama­zon Live early last year. Sin­ga­pore ecom­merce plat­form Shopee made a sim­i­lar move as it took on Alibaba’s Lazada in the same re­gion.</p>
    <p>Within China, part of the push for re­tail­ers to take live-stream­ing abroad comes from its e-com­merce be­he­moths such as Alibaba.</p>
    <p>Its global re­tail arm Ali­Ex­press launched a plat­form in May to draw over 100,000 con­tent creators, in­clud­ing live-stream­ers, this year to mar­ket abroad. They are eye­ing a one mil­lion-strong pool of in­flu­encers within three years, to be paired with brands and mer­chants look­ing to hawk their goods across the world.</p>
    <p>The live-stream is still “weird” in coun­tries like France, but it has gained ground in other mar­kets like Rus­sia, said Ms Alice Roche, a Shang­hai-based me­dia planner who hosts shows in French and Eng­lish, sell­ing goods from mas­sage ma­chines to cos­met­ics.</p>
    <p>“In sev­eral years, (live-stream­ing) will be the main way we choose prod­ucts,” she added.</p>
