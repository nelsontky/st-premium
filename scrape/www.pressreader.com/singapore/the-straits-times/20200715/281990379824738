    <p>At 175 years, The Straits Times rep­re­sents a feat of sur­vival in­ter­twined with the wider story of Sin­ga­pore. The news­pa­per has been an in­valu­able wit­ness of this is­land’s past. Like Sin­ga­pore, it sur­vived colo­nial­ism, the Great De­pres­sion, World War II, the Ja­panese in­va­sion and oc­cu­pa­tion, the early chal­lenges of in­de­pen­dence and re­ces­sions that could have un­made Sin­ga­pore. In the present Covidean era, it has been a com­pan­ion on the side of Sin­ga­pore­ans as they bat­tle the cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion on both health and eco­nomic fronts.</p>
    <p>It has every in­ten­tion of be­ing a com­pan­ion to read­ers and cit­i­zens in the fu­ture as well. As news, like Sin­ga­pore, con­tin­ues to evolve, The Straits Times strives to re­main a me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tion that makes timely, au­thor­i­ta­tive and cred­i­ble in­for­ma­tion avail­able to read­ers, across its plat­forms, so they can make in­formed and crit­i­cal de­ci­sions which af­fect their lives and those of their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>All me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions live to re­port and re­flect on their times. What dis­tin­guishes the sur­vivors from the fallen is an abil­ity to have reach and stay rel­e­vant, to act as a mir­ror to de­vel­op­ments at home and a win­dow to those abroad, pro­vide ac­cu­rate in­ter­pre­ta­tive con­text based on a cul­ture of val­ues shared with read­ers, and be bal­anced in the de­liv­ery of news. Bal­ance in­volves weigh­ing dif­fer­ent per­cep­tions of events so as to give recog­ni­tion to the ar­gu­ments of pol­i­cy­mak­ers, crit­ics and, im­por­tantly, of the cit­i­zen who is the ul­ti­mate ob­ject of pol­icy. Reach is broad­ened when read­ers con­tinue to have trust in the ac­cu­racy, re­li­a­bil­ity and truth­ful­ness of the news they re­ceive on their doorstep, smart­phones, tablets or other de­vices.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has kept pace with Sin­ga­pore’s ex­ter­nal space – its wide in­ter­ests and plans re­gion­ally and in­ter­na­tion­ally. Its ori­gins in 1845 lie in the trans­for­ma­tive im­pe­tus given to Sin­ga­pore’s ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion af­ter the ar­rival of Stam­ford Raf­fles in 1819. Since then, Sin­ga­pore has be­come a world-class city rooted in its South­east Asian prove­nance. The pa­per has moved ac­cord­ingly, with a net­work of bu­reaus giv­ing read­ers a view of the world, with an out­look that draws of­ten on what is of value and im­por­tance to Sin­ga­pore. And just as print, ra­dio and tele­vi­sion marked the tech­no­log­i­cal evo­lu­tion of news pro­duc­tion, dis­tri­bu­tion and con­sump­tion, the chal­lenge posed by the on­line sphere – where mis­in­for­ma­tion is in free flow and chat­ter mas­quer­ades as news – has been met head-on and with vigour.</p>
    <p>Words, im­ages and sounds have been and re­main the means of out­reach to au­di­ences past, present and in the fu­ture. While the modes of de­liv­ery may evolve, there has al­ways been a need for timely, re­li­able and ac­cu­rate news. The Straits Times has done so for 175 years, and has lasted be­cause of the sup­port – and trust – it has earned from its read­ers. We are in­debted to you for it.</p>
