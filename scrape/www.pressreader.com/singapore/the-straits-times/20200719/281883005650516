    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Twit­ter said sev­eral of its em­ploy­ees were ma­nip­u­lated by hack­ers into pro­vid­ing cre­den­tials for in­ter­nal sys­tems, and 130 Twit­ter ac­counts were tar­geted, in­clud­ing those of United States pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den, en­trepreneur Elon Musk and Ama­zon chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Be­zos.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers were able to re­set pass­words for 45 users, while eight had their data, in­clud­ing pri­vate mes­sages, down­loaded en­tirely, Twit­ter said in a blog post late on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>While the hack tar­geted high­pro­file users such as for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama and busi­ness ty­coon War­ren Buf­fett, Twit­ter clar­i­fied that data was not down­loaded from any ver­i­fied ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers may have also tried to sell the user­names of some of the ac­counts, it said.</p>
    <p>“There are some de­tails – par­tic­u­larly around re­me­di­a­tion – that we are not pro­vid­ing right now to pro­tect the security of the ef­fort,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter did not say, for in­stance, whether the hack­ers read any of the pri­vate mes­sages of world lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The at­tack last Wed­nes­day in­volved a wide­spread scam, us­ing the ac­counts of cryp­tocur­rency firms, cor­po­rate lead­ers and celebri­ties to so­licit Bit­coin trans­fers, in ex­change for a prom­ise of dou­bling the money.</p>
    <p>Pub­licly avail­able blockchain records show the scam­mers got over US$100,000 (S$139,000) worth of cryp­tocur­rency.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter is work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, to iden­tify the hack­ers and fig­ure out the ex­tent to which users’ data was com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>The New York Times re­ported on Fri­day that the hack­ers were young pals with no links to state or or­gan­ised crime.</p>
    <p>It said it had in­ter­viewed four peo­ple who took part in the hack­ing and who shared logs and screen­shots back­ing up their ac­counts of what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>They said a mys­te­ri­ous user who went by the name “Kirk” ini­ti­ated the scheme with a mes­sage and was the one with ac­cess to Twit­ter ac­counts.</p>
