    <p>Sin­ga­pore is seek­ing to open the door to a wider range of busi­ness and leisure vis­i­tors to boost its hard-hit tourism sec­tor, with the re­turn of mass travel still a long way off amid the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to the head of the coun­try’s tourism agency.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try ex­pects more job losses in the com­ing months once ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment sup­port for rent, taxes and salaries starts ta­per­ing off, Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Keith Tan said on Tues­day in an in­ter­view with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Job losses so far in the sec­tor have been in the “very low thou­sands”, he said. “Whether it is a broader range of busi­ness vis­i­tors or, for ex­am­ple, small groups of tightly con­trolled leisure vis­i­tors, all these are be­ing con­sid­ered and are on the ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added that the tourism board is dis­cussing with the Gov­ern­ment to ex­pand green lane ar­range­ments, now in place with Malaysia and China, to a broader range of vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s travel-re­lated sec­tors, which con­trib­ute about 4 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, is grap­pling with what could be the citys­tate’s worst re­ces­sion wrought by the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales plunged by more than 50 per cent in May from a year ear­lier, with out­lets try­ing to woo tourists in ar­eas like the Or­chard Road shop­ping strip par­tic­u­larly hard hit.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s bor­ders re­main largely shut to ex­ter­nal ar­rivals. Vis­its in June reached 2,200, down from 1.6 mil­lion in the same month last year. The green lane travel ar­range­ments cur­rently al­low only busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel, sub­ject to test­ing.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has launched a do­mes­tic travel cam­paign to sup­port the in­dus­try, though lo­cal de­mand would not fill the hole left by the ab­sence of in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors, said Mr Tan. These trav­ellers con­trib­uted to al­most $28 bil­lion in tourism re­ceipts last year.</p>
    <p>“It will be a long while more be­fore mass travel can re­sume and that ul­ti­mately stems from con­sumer con­fi­dence,” said Mr Tan, who added that a vac­cine or ef­fec­tive ther­a­pies are needed to com­bat the “fear and anx­i­ety” many peo­ple have, even of step­ping onto an air­plane.</p>
    <p>World­wide, the in­dus­try is ex­pected to lose US$3.3 tril­lion (S$4.5 tril­lion) if the col­lapse of global leisure travel per­sists un­til next March, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions Con­fer­ence on Trade and De­vel­op­ment last month. Virus resur­gences across Asia in coun­tries like Viet­nam and Ja­pan have hurt hopes of an early re­cov­ery of mass travel.</p>
    <p>Still, Sin­ga­pore has af­firmed plans to in­vest in en­hanc­ing its tourism hub sta­tus, in­clud­ing a $9 bil­lion ex­pan­sion of its two in­te­grated re­sorts by Las Ve­gas Sands and Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan warned, how­ever, that “in­evitable delays” will oc­cur due to a slow­down in con­struc­tion ac­tiv­ity and labour chal­lenges.</p>
