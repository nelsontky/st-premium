    <p>Most own­ers of the units on the land with a 60-year lease in Gey­lang Lorong 3 have found new homes, with the re­main­ing few still con­sid­er­ing their op­tions.</p>
    <p>The land will be re­turned to the state, when the leases ex­pire on Dec 31, for re­de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>There are 191 ter­raced homes sit­ting on the plot, of which 149 are va­cant, used as for­eign work­ers’ lodg­ing or for reli­gious ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Five were re­turned to the state ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Of the 37 owner-oc­cu­pied units, 32 have fi­nalised their next home, with some mov­ing in with fam­ily mem­bers or buy­ing new flats, said the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The six who bought new flats that will not be ready by the Dec 31 dead­line have been of­fered Hous­ing Board homes un­der the Interim Rental Hous­ing Scheme.</p>
    <p>SLA said help is be­ing of­fered to the own­ers of the re­main­ing five units who are still con­sid­er­ing their hous­ing op­tions.</p>
    <p>Four are in the process of mov­ing out to interim rental flats, while the fifth has made al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>SLA had an­nounced in 2017 that the houses will go back to the state when their lease ex­pires.</p>
    <p>The site is slated for pub­lic hous­ing as part of a larger plan to re­ju­ve­nate Kal­lang, said SLA.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all the prop­er­ties have been re­turned to the state upon lease ex­piry, SLA will hoard up and clear the site to pre­pare it for re­de­vel­op­ment,” the agency said.</p>
    <p>SLA had eased the early re­turn of prop­er­ties from own­ers by waiv­ing the pro­cess­ing fees and fa­cil­i­tat­ing the re­fund of the out­stand­ing prop­erty tax amount.</p>
    <p>For the units used to house for­eign work­ers, SLA and the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) have con­tacted their em­ploy­ers to re­lo­cate them in other ap­proved hous­ing, like pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOM said about 700 work­ers en­gaged by nearly 200 em­ploy­ers re­side in Gey­lang Lorong 3.</p>
    <p>About one-third of the em­ploy­ers have found al­ter­na­tive ac­com­mo­da­tion for 221 work­ers while the oth­ers are in the midst of get­ting them housed else­where, the MOM spokesman added.</p>
    <p>“We have also as­sured em­ploy­ers there are suf­fi­cient bed spa­ces in pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries to house their work­ers,” MOM said.</p>
    <p>Those who used the Gey­lang units for reli­gious ac­tiv­i­ties have been ad­vised to con­sider co-lo­cat­ing with reli­gious groups op­er­at­ing else­where, or rent­ing space in com­mer­cial or in­dus­trial premises with a des­ig­nated por­tion for reli­gious pur­poses, SLA said.</p>
    <p>Of the 16 who did so, 13 have made re­lo­ca­tion plans or have de­cided to wind down, while the rest are con­sid­er­ing their op­tions.</p>
    <p>On the need to take back the plot, SLA said: “The Gov­ern­ment takes into con­sid­er­a­tion var­i­ous na­tional, so­cial and eco­nomic needs in mak­ing land-plan­ning de­ci­sions and re­de­vel­op­ment plans. The re­turn of lease­hold land to the state upon lease ex­piry en­ables the land to be rejuvenate­d to meet th­ese var­i­ous needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>This is the first time a res­i­den­tial plot in in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore has reached the end of its lease.</p>
    <p>The houses in Jalan Chempaka Kun­ing and Jalan Chempaka Puteh, near Tanah Merah MRT sta­tion, are next in line. Their 70-year lease is due to ex­pire in 2034.</p>
