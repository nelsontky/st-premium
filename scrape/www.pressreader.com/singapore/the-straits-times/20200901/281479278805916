    <p>Af­ter stray­ing off­side with their ques­tion­able mar­ket­ing ma­te­rial, Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group’s ill­fated bid to take over New­cas­tle United looks likely to end in de­feat.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Press As­so­ci­a­tion re­ported that its £280 mil­lion (S$507 mil­lion) bid “never came close to earn­ing (BN Group)... a seat around the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble” and the deal is not be­ing ex­plored.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter New­castle­based news­pa­per The Chron­i­cle car­ried a re­port on Satur­day with the head­line “Mike Ash­ley ready to pull the plug on two bid­ders and make fresh search for in­vest­ment this au­tumn”.</p>
    <p>It added the Premier League club are “still up for sale” but owner Ash­ley had l ost pa­tience with two groups of prospec­tive buy­ers.</p>
    <p>It was be­lieved that BN Group, co-founded by Sin­ga­porean en­trepreneur­s and cousins Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh, and Chi­nese lawyer and j ewellery mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen, had not in­creased their ini­tial of­fer of £280 mil­lion, with the pro­posal fail­ing to get be­yond Ash­ley’s le­gal team. The other bid was from Amer­i­can TV mogul Henry Mau­riss, who had not fol­lowed up on his ver­bal agree­ment to a £350 mil­lion deal af­ter hold­ing dis­cus­sions with the owner and his close aide Chris Ronnie ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, Ash­ley had agreed to the £300 mil­lion bid by Saudi Ara­bia’s Pub­lic In­vest­ment Fund, which col­lapsed af­ter the group de­clined to take up the league’s of­fer of in­de­pen­dent ar­bi­tra­tion to de­cide who would own the club.</p>
    <p>The Chron­i­cle also cited sources close to the BN Group who claimed it is try­ing to get on with its busi­ness qui­etly and are des­per­ate to ad­here to Ash­ley’s wish to keep de­vel­op­ments out of the press.</p>
    <p>The pa­per said that ne­go­ti­a­tions will con­tinue via the re­spec­tive le­gal teams, although Ash­ley is still said to favour a re­sus­ci­ta­tion of the Saudi bid.</p>
    <p>An an­a­lyst, who de­clined to be named, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “I have not heard of the BN Group or the Lohs be­fore this saga, and I be­lieve many haven’t as well, which begs the ques­tion how can there be in­ter­na­tion­ally suc­cess­ful Sin­ga­porean busi­ness­men out there buy­ing a prom­i­nent foot­ball team and so few peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore have heard of them?</p>
    <p>“The group’s re­ported bid was £280 mil­lion, when Mike Ash­ley al­ready had and ac­cepted a £300 mil­lion of­fer.</p>
    <p>“Why bid lower than that agreed price? Maybe it is a good way to get public­ity with­out hav­ing to buy?”</p>
    <p>Since an­nounc­ing on Aug 15 that it was “at an ad­vanced stage of ne­go­ti­a­tions” with New­cas­tle, the BN Group and its co-founders had been shrouded in con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>On Aug 22, Reuters re­ported BN Group head of global mar­ket­ing and in­vestor re­la­tions Nerei­des An­to­nio Gi­a­mundo de Bour­bon as ad­mit­ting that some public­ity pho­tos of the co-founders with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama had been pho­to­shopped.</p>
    <p>ST checks also un­cov­ered a pat­tern of out­landish and ques­tion­able claims in the in­ter­views, press re­leases and so­cial me­dia ac­counts of the founders. Th­ese range from ex­ag­ger­a­tions to mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The group has since ei­ther re­tracted or deleted press re­leases that were on­line, and also locked their web­site and In­sta­gram ac­count.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish sports jour­nal­ist Liam Kennedy, who first broke the story of the bid in Ty­ne­side news­pa­per Shields Gazette, told ST he was al­ready scep­ti­cal from the start, and felt the deal would not go through.</p>
    <p>He said: “New­cas­tle United fans want change – they’re des­per­ate for it – but it has to be for the bet­ter. And there is a sense this BNG bid could be a recipe for dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>“Mike Ash­ley is not even en­ter­tain­ing it – and that speaks vol­umes, given he is so des­per­ate to sell the foot­ball club.”</p>
    <p>At press time, BN Group did not re­spond to ST queries.</p>
    <p>DE­GREE OF DOUBT</p>
    <p>Mike Ash­ley is not even en­ter­tain­ing it – and that speaks vol­umes, given he is so des­per­ate to sell the foot­ball club.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
