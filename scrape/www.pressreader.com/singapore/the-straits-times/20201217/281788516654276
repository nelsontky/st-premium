    <p>•</p>
    <p>SYDNEY Can­berra is launch­ing a for­mal ap­peal to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO), seek­ing a re­view of Bei­jing’s de­ci­sion to im­pose hefty tar­iffs on im­ports of Aus­tralian bar­ley.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that the ap­peal may take years to be re­solved, Trade Min­is­ter Simon Birm­ing­ham yes­ter­day said Aus­tralia had lit­tle choice af­ter China in May im­posed five years of anti-dump­ing and anti-sub­sidy du­ties to­talling 80.5 per cent on Aus­tralian bar­ley – ef­fec­tively stop­ping a bil­lion-dol­lar trade in its tracks.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralia has an in­cred­i­bly strong case to mount in re­la­tion to de­fend­ing the in­tegrity and pro­pri­etary of our grain grow­ers and bar­ley pro­duc­ers,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>The ap­peal to the in­de­pen­dent trade body threat­ens to fur­ther stoke bi­lat­eral ten­sions that have al­ready seen China im­pose tar­iffs on a range of Aus­tralian com­modi­ties, while diplo­matic com­mu­ni­ca­tion has been lim­ited.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship with China, al­ready rocky af­ter Aus­tralia in 2018 banned Huawei from its nascent 5G broad­band network, cooled fur­ther af­ter Can­berra called this year for an in­de­pen­dent investigat­ion into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, first re­ported in cen­tral China last year.</p>
    <p>China has since lim­ited beef im­ports, im­posed tar­iffs on Aus­tralian wine and told its millers to stop buy­ing Aus­tralian cot­ton.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry in Bei­jing de­clined to com­ment on Aus­tralia’s planned WTO ap­peal.</p>
    <p>“I just want to stress that the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment should take China’s con­cerns se­ri­ously, and take con­crete ac­tions to cor­rect its dis­crim­i­na­tory ac­tions against Chi­nese com­pa­nies,” said min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin at a reg­u­lar brief­ing.</p>
    <p>While some have said that Aus­tralia should seek a truce with China, Can­berra’s Con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment is un­der grow­ing pres­sure from farm­ers who face five years with­out be­ing able to sell to what has been their most lu­cra­tive mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“It is im­per­a­tive that we sup­port the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of global trade and the rules that gov­ern it,” said Na­tional Farm­ers Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Fiona Sim­son in an e-mailed state­ment is­sued af­ter Mr Birm­ing­ham an­nounced the WTO move.</p>
    <p>About 70 per cent of Aus­tralian ex­ports of the grain typ­i­cally go to China, Aus­tralian data shows.</p>
    <p>The ef­fec­tive block on sales to China also comes as Aus­tralian bar­ley pro­duc­tion is ex­pected to hit nearly 12 mil­lion tonnes this crop year, af­ter rain re­vived some of the big­gest grow­ing re­gions fol­low­ing years of drought.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment sources, how­ever, have warned that the WTO ac­tion would not yield quick re­sults. The first stage of the ap­peal will seek for­mal talks be­tween Aus­tralia and China, which are not ex­pected un­til early next year.</p>
    <p>“We ap­pealed a few months ago and they re­jected that. So it seems un­likely that China will ad­mit they were wrong,” said one per­son fa­mil­iar with the de­tails of the case who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>Should talks be­tween Aus­tralia and China fail to yield a re­sult, an in­de­pen­dent panel of ex­perts will be set up to look into the is­sue. Aus­tralia ex­pects this could take sev­eral years.</p>
