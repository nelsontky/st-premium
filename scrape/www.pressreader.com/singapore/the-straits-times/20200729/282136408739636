    <p>Grab is seek­ing to charge pas­sen­gers an ex­tra 32 cents for each ride here as a “plat­form fee”, and the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) said it is seek­ing public feed­back on the ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tor said the fee will en­able it to main­tain and en­hance safety mea­sures and go to­wards cov­er­ing op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Its move to in­tro­duce a fee has to go through CCCS un­der di­rec­tions set in Septem­ber 2018 fol­low­ing a Grab-Uber merger in which Uber sold its South-east Asian busi­ness to Grab for a 27.5 per cent stake in the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tions, which in­cluded a re­quire­ment for Grab to main­tain its pre-merger pric­ing, pric­ing poli­cies and prod­uct op­tions across its prod­ucts, were in­tended by CCCS to lessen the im­pact of the merger on driv­ers and rid­ers, open up the mar­ket and to level the play­ing field for new en­trants.</p>
    <p>CCCS said in 2018 it will sus­pend the di­rec­tions in­def­i­nitely if a com­peti­tor at­tains 30 per cent or more of to­tal rides matched across ride­hail­ing plat­form services for one month. All di­rec­tions would be re­leased un­con­di­tion­ally if a com­peti­tor at­tains the same 30 per cent mar­ket share for six con­sec­u­tive cal­en­dar months.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, CCCS said Grab had sub­mit­ted that the pro­posed plat­form fee con­forms to norms within the ride-hail­ing in­dus­try and one-third of the funds col­lected as a re­sult of the fee will go to­wards pro­vid­ing Grab driv­ers with more wel­fare ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>In March, Go­jek, which en­tered the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket in Novem­ber 2018, in­tro­duced a 70-cent sur­charge on trips booked through its plat­form, which the firm said would fund im­prove­ments to its ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said ex­per­i­ment­ing with prices out of busi­ness ne­ces­sity is not un­usual for ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tors, and that Grab would likely have changed its fare struc­ture in re­sponse to the com­pet­i­tive sit­u­a­tion ear­lier if not for the CCCS di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Hin Kee, the ex­ec­u­tive ad­viser to the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion and the Na­tional Private Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion, said he hoped that be­yond con­sid­er­ing Grab’s ap­pli­ca­tion to in­tro­duce plat­form fees, the com­pe­ti­tion watch­dog would also con­sider the di­rec­tions in their en­tirety, and how they might af­fect private-hire driv­ers amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said: “En­sur­ing that the mar­ket is com­pet­i­tive is a good start­ing point, but the Covid-19 con­text is un­like 2018 (when the di­rec­tions were is­sued) – even big play­ers (like Grab) are fac­ing a shrink­ing mar­ket size. This has a big im­pact on driv­ers and the vi­a­bil­ity of the op­er­a­tors.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ang added that while driv­ers are pri­mar­ily con­cerned with the com­mis­sions they pay to ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tors, any ini­tia­tive that might in­crease rid­ing costs would also worry driv­ers, as commuters might go for cheaper al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>CCCS said it will con­sider public feed­back in its as­sess­ment of Grab’s ap­pli­ca­tion, in­clud­ing fac­tors such as cost re­cov­ery and Grab’s in­vest­ment in pas­sen­ger safety and driver wel­fare.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on the public con­sul­ta­tion is avail­able on CCCS’ web­site.</p>
    <p>Those wish­ing to give feed­back can e-mail CCCS_Feed­back@ cccs.gov.sg by Aug 11.</p>
