    <p>Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club (SICC), the coun­try’s old­est golf club, has dis­cov­ered “sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­i­ties” in its on­line book­ing sys­tem for golf games, with some mem­bers’ ac­counts us­ing bots or scripted pro­grams to se­cure pop­u­lar time slots.</p>
    <p>These in­ci­dents could con­sti­tute a pos­si­ble breach of the Computer Mis­use and Cy­ber­se­cu­rity Act and the club has re­ported them to the au­thor­i­ties, SICC said in a note to its mem­bers on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing. Yes­ter­day, an SICC spokesman told The Straits Times that its golf book­ing sys­tem “has worked with­out in­ci­dent all this while un­til the re­cent post cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when, like all other clubs, we ex­pe­ri­enced a surge in de­mand from mem­bers wish­ing to play”.</p>
    <p>Since the club de­tected the book­ings made by bots in July, it has been mon­i­tor­ing the trans­ac­tions, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>At the same time, there were sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­i­ties re­sult­ing from some mem­bers us­ing soft­ware pro­grams to pre-book flights to se­cure tee times.</p>
    <p>But no per­sonal data has been com­pro­mised, the club said.</p>
    <p>In its note to mem­bers, SICC stated that mem­bers had said they were un­able to se­cure golf flights which were snapped up “within min­utes”. Also, at the start of each on­line book­ing time, there were more than 2,000 book­ing at­tempts.</p>
    <p>It fur­ther said that more than 50 per cent of on­line golf book­ings were com­pleted within sec­onds af­ter the win­dow opens, with the fastest be­ing com­pleted in two sec­onds.</p>
    <p>SICC has four 18-hole cour­ses – Is­land, New, Bukit and Sime – lo­cated across its premises around</p>
    <p>At­tempts at the start of each on­line book­ing time for slots at the Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club.</p>
    <p>MacRitchie Reser­voir. It has about 18,000 mem­bers and mem­ber­ship fees are about $200,000.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said the club has strength­ened the golf book­ing sys­tem and that other than these new is­sues, it has been work­ing fine and re­mains ro­bust.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, the club said those mem­ber ac­counts in­volved in us­ing bots and scripted pro­grams have been sus­pended pend­ing fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman added: “We are in­deed dis­ap­pointed with these acts by a very small seg­ment of the mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>“We will not hes­i­tate to take the ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tions against wrong­do­ers and send a clear sig­nal that we will do what is nec­es­sary to pro­tect the in­ter­est of the mem­ber­ship at large.”</p>
    <p>The club now restricts mem­bers to re­serve a tee time us­ing only one ac­tive book­ing ses­sion at any one time, in­stead of the pre­vi­ous mul­ti­ple book­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent the use of au­to­mated bots or scripted pro­grams, SICC said it will also im­ple­ment Captcha (Com­pletely Au­to­mated Pub­lic Tur­ing Test to tell Com­put­ers and Hu­mans Apart) ver­i­fi­ca­tions, which in­clude an ex­tra step at the start of the ac­tive golf book­ing ses­sion.</p>
