    <p>TOKYO • An ir­re­sistible prospect for bud­ding bad­minton play­ers, to be coached by world No. 1 Kento Mo­mota has arisen, after the Ja­panese trig­gered thou­sands of re­sponses by of­fer­ing his ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Would any­one like to play bad­minton with me?” the Ja­panese tweeted on Tues­day. “I also want to teach peo­ple bad­minton. I want peo­ple to know how fun this is.”</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old, who was in­jured in a car crash in Jan­uary in Malaysia, is a gold medal hope for Ja­pan at the now-post­poned Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>He spent months re­cu­per­at­ing after the crash, which killed the driver of his ve­hi­cle and left him with eye in­juries.</p>
    <p>His coach­ing of­fer – for just two lucky stu­dents – at­tracted a flood of ap­pli­cants, rang­ing from par­ents ap­ply­ing for their chil­dren to fel­low sports stars.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese swim­mer Daiya Seto, who won a bronze in the Rio Olympic Games in the 400m in­di­vid­ual med­ley, tweeted: “Wanna do this!” But Mo­mota replied: “I don’t want you be­cause you might be too good at it!”</p>
    <p>For­mer Ja­pan foot­baller Hiroshi Kiy­otake also put up his hand, prompt­ing Mo­mota to of­fer a trade: “Let’s do this in pri­vate. Teach me how to jug­gle a foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Even Mo­mota’s na­tional bad­minton team­mate Kanta Tsuneyama asked for a shot.</p>
    <p>De­tails are not yet de­cided, but the world’s top-ranked shut­tler said he would wait un­til next month be­fore de­cid­ing which stu­dents to take.</p>
    <p>The two-time world cham­pion said in June he had fully re­cov­ered from his in­juries and was back on track for the Olympics. Tokyo 2020 had been sched­uled to open in July, but was post­poned for a year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus and is slated to be­gin next July.</p>
    <p>TOO GOOD</p>
    <p>I don’t want you be­cause you might be too good at it!</p>
    <p>’’</p>
