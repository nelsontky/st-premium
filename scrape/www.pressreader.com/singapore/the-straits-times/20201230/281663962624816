    <p>For 13-year-old Teng Xin Rui, more days of school­ing from home will mean more days of sleep­ing in.</p>
    <p>The Se­condary 1 stu­dent at Be­dok South Se­condary School has to wake up at 5.30am to make it in time for school, some­thing that many stu­dents here face on a daily ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“I think more days of home­based learn­ing (HBL) are good be­cause I will get a break and more time to rest,” she said.</p>
    <p>Xin Rui was re­act­ing to the new Min­istry of Education (MOE) guide­lines an­nounced by Min­is­ter for Education Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day – that all se­condary schools and ju­nior col­leges, in­clud­ing Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute, will have one day of HBL ev­ery two weeks for some lev­els from Term 3 of next year.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the reg­u­lar­ity of HBL days dif­fered across schools, with some having e-learn­ing weeks and oth­ers con­duct­ing HBL less reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>All lev­els wi l l im­ple­ment blended learn­ing – a mix of in­school and home-based les­sons – by the end of Term 4 of 2022.</p>
    <p>This seeks to “pro­vide stu­dents with more op­por­tu­ni­ties to learn at their own pace and to be em­pow­ered to take charge of their learn­ing”, ac­cord­ing to an MOE press re­lease yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents and par­ents whom The Straits Times spoke to had mixed feel­ings about the move.</p>
    <p>Xin Rui’s mother, Mrs Pauline Teng, who works in mar­ket­ing, said that while she is sup­port­ive of HBL, it may be dif­fi­cult for other fam­i­lies and for younger chil­dren to adapt.</p>
    <p>“For me, it’s okay be­cause we have helpers at home, and the chil­dren who are al­ready in se­condary school are quite in­de­pen­dent. The con­cern is for those who don’t have a fam­ily mem­ber around,” said the 48-year-old mother of three, who also has two boys, aged 11 and 16.</p>
    <p>Xin Rui, how­ever, said the com­forts of home some­times made HBL less ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“I find I am less pro­duc­tive when I’m study­ing on­line,” she said.</p>
    <p>Other par­ents and stu­dents are happy with the in­creased amount of fam­ily time that HBL brings.</p>
    <p>Com­pany di­rec­tor Michael Lim, 58, said that HBL dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod meant more time and meals with his son David, a 17-year-old Nanyang Ju­nior Col­lege stu­dent.</p>
    <p>David also found that HBL ben­e­fited him.</p>
    <p>“I en­joy learn­ing at my own pace, and man­ag­ing my own time. HBL can help you be­come more in­de­pen­dent,” said David, who will be tak­ing his A lev­els next year.</p>
    <p>Pref­er­ences notwith­stand­ing, more on­line learn­ing may be an even­tu­al­ity rather than an op­tion.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, this may be the way for­ward,” said Mrs Teng. “I’m agree­able (to more HBL) as long as the kids are en­gaged in les­sons and not just do­ing as­sign­ments at home.</p>
