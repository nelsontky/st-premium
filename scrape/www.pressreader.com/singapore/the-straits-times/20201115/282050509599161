    <p>Work­ing from home has been a fer­tile breed­ing ground for the bak­ing craze to bloom all over the world. Flour and bak­ing sup­ply short­ages were re­ported from Sur­rey to Sengkang, and Bos­ton to Bis­han.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, the craze stemmed from peo­ple knead­ing to re­duce stress. The sheer act of shap­ing and form­ing dough has helped many to over­come the en­nui of lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Our fam­ily’s bread-mak­ing jour­ney started dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker in Sin­ga­pore from April to June. For my wife F, chief bak­ing in­sti­ga­tor and dough whis­perer, bread-mak­ing was the out­let that made the multi-month, work-from-home sen­tence some­what bear­able.</p>
    <p>A freshly baked crusty loaf is the per­fect rem­edy for the ab­sence of so­cial in­ter­ac­tion. Each loaf’s prom­ise of fam­ily and hu­man con­nec­tion is de­liv­ered in full, when it is bro­ken and shared.</p>
    <p>“Bread gives us a sense of place,” says Tara Jensen (In­sta­gram han­dle @Bak­erHands) a star ar­ti­sanal baker based in the United</p>
    <p>States. “It’s an an­chor, not just for one per­son but for the whole com­mu­nity. It gives you a sense of where you are when you eat it.”</p>
    <p>As each loaf is baked and con­sumed by our fam­ily, or de­liv­ered to friends and neigh­bours, Jensen’s words be­come a re­al­ity: “I love the prac­tice of bak­ing… what my work con­sists of, is other peo­ple and re­la­tion­ships we have with each other. Bread is the ve­hi­cle through which these con­nec­tions are forged and up­held.”</p>
    <p>The power of fresh bread goes be­yond com­mu­nity and hu­man re­la­tion­ships. Re­searchers from the Univer­sity of South­ern Brit­tany in France found in 2012 that pleas­ant aro­mas from bread bak­ing ac­tu­ally led peo­ple to be kinder and more con­sid­er­ate to strangers, as com­pared with when the smell of bak­ing was ab­sent.</p>
    <p>The pa­per pub­lished in the Journal of So­cial Psy­chol­ogy with the ti­tle “The Sweet Smell of Im­plicit Help­ing” un­cov­ered the link be­tween the smell of bak­ing bread and help­ful, con­sid­er­ate be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>More than 20 years ago, as new­ly­weds on a three-year work as­sign­ment in Frank­furt, Ger­many, my wife and I lived on the sec­ond floor in an apart­ment di­rectly above a tra­di­tional Ger­man bak­ery.</p>
    <p>The smell of freshly baked bread woke us up ev­ery morn­ing and in­ter­min­gled with our dreams in the wee hours of the morn­ing dur­ing our time of deep­est sleep.</p>
    <p>In the light of the French study, the good smells could have helped en­cour­age more con­sid­er­ate be­hav­iour in how we in­ter­acted as a young cou­ple. Small ges­tures, such as get­ting a bev­er­age for your spouse while you are get­ting one for your­self, kept dis­agree­ments be­tween us then to a min­i­mum. Many of the nascent habits that be­gan dur­ing our time liv­ing above the bak­ery have en­dured over our more than two decades of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Bread-bak­ing has taught our fam­ily three pre­cious lessons over the past few months.</p>
    <p>The first les­son is im­pro­vi­sa­tion. Eschew­ing the spe­cialised gear in semi-pro­fes­sional home bak­ing stores, my wife’s Dutch oven is made up of two old cake tins joined by two metal clips. She has since co-opted an old clay pot to serve as the same.</p>
    <p>Her baguette flip­ping board is a piece of used card­board cov­ered in alu­minium foil, while her baker’s couche – a cloth used to help the dough keep its shape while it is prov­ing – is an old pil­low case.</p>
    <p>The im­pro­vised tools do not af­fect the taste or qual­ity of the baked bread, not to men­tion sav­ing us hun­dreds of dol­lars on gear, which would add to our al­ready clut­tered kitchen.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond les­son is about deal­ing with fail­ure. At the heart of the mat­ter, bak­ing bread is about man­ag­ing a liv­ing thing, a bread starter or yeast that causes the bread to rise.</p>
    <p>My wife’s home sour dough starter is now four months old. Her first starter died in early June, when she un­know­ingly added chlo­ri­nated wa­ter into the starter mix, killing the ac­tive mi­crobes in it. That was a dark day for our fam­ily of four.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral days of “mourn­ing” were de­clared, and the ovens in our home went cold, as we sought to re­cover and make sense of our loss. For­tu­nately, after a week, my wife was able to take the ten­ta­tive steps to start­ing up a new sour dough starter from scratch, and re­turned to bread-bak­ing again.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal les­son is about how bread-mak­ing is about bak­ing a fam­ily loaf. Be­tween feed­ing and main­tain­ing the starter with flour and wa­ter, clean­ing up after a bak­ing ses­sion, and sit­ting down to the suc­cesses and fail­ures that emerge from the oven, bread-mak­ing has be­come a fam­ily af­fair, with each mem­ber ready to lend a hand if some­thing needs to be done.</p>
    <p>Our fam­ily’s meal­time con­ver­sa­tions have been pep­pered with dis­cus­sions on the chem­istry of the bread, how the starter is do­ing, and the kind of bread to bake next. It has been eight months since we last bought bread from the store, thanks to our once-a-week bakes that pro­vide us our daily fix.</p>
    <p>When a loaf comes out of the oven, I of­ten think of the fa­mil­iar lines of the open­ing cred­its of the clas­sic TV show ABC’s Wide World Of Sports: “The thrill of vic­tory and the agony of de­feat, the hu­man drama of ath­letic com­pe­ti­tion.” In this case, the com­pe­ti­tion is about how well the bread has turned out and who will get the last slice of bread.</p>
    <p>Un­der these stress­ful times of the pandemic, such friendly com­pe­ti­tion, even if it is just about rel­ish­ing our freshly home-baked cre­ations, helps us bond as a fam­ily as we share a meal and break bread to­gether.</p>
