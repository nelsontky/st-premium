    <p>In 2008, at eight months old, Raphael Lee was di­ag­nosed with rhab­domyosar­coma in his left fore­arm.</p>
    <p>He un­der­went treat­ment for this rare form of soft tis­sue cancer for a year and the disease went into re­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>But in 2016, when Raphael was a Pri­mary 2 pupil, he was di­ag­nosed with os­teosar­coma, or bone cancer. It started in his left arm again, and even­tu­ally spread to his right col­lar­bone and both lungs.</p>
    <p>On Nov 13, the 12-year-old died due to com­pli­ca­tions from surgery.</p>
    <p>His par­ents, Mr Wil­liam Lee, 47, and Mrs Win­nie Lee, 45, col­lected his Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) re­sults from Alexan­dra Pri­mary School on his be­half yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Raphael, their only child, had scored 220, with As for math­e­mat­ics and science and Bs for English and mother tongue.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who works as a course man­ager with non-profit hu­man­i­tar­ian or­gan­i­sa­tion St John Sin­ga­pore, said: “We ex­pected his life­span would be short­ened, but we didn’t know death would come so soon.</p>
    <p>“We told him that our fo­cus was not on his stud­ies but on his health. We would tell him, ‘Just do your best, there is no stress’, but he wanted to prove him­self.”</p>
    <p>The Catholic cou­ple said that the Church of St Ber­nadette, which they at­tend, as well as Raphael’s school have been very sup­port­ive through­out this chal­leng­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Raphael’s teach­ers of­ten vis­ited him in hos­pi­tal and at home, and brought his school work to him.</p>
    <p>They also fre­quently sent video clips of class ac­tiv­i­ties to up­date him on what he had missed, and passed along greet­ings from his class­mates to en­cour­age him.</p>
    <p>When Raphael was di­ag­nosed with bone cancer in his left arm in 2016, he un­der­went cryother­apy, which in­volved us­ing liq­uid ni­tro­gen to de­stroy the cancer cells.</p>
    <p>But the very next year, doc­tors found an­other swelling near his left wrist and said that am­pu­ta­tion was in­evitable.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lee: “Raphael was dev­as­tated when he heard he had to lose his arm. But we told him that the hope was that we would sac­ri­fice the arm in re­turn for his good health in fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The boy then took it in his stride, he said, manag­ing to smile and cheer up fam­ily and friends who vis­ited him af­ter his oper­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Last year, an­other tu­mour was dis­cov­ered rest­ing on his right col­lar­bone. “It caught the whole med­i­cal team by sur­prise be­cause ev­ery­one thought the am­pu­ta­tion would end the episode,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>In March this year, a mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing scan showed the cancer had spread to his lungs. He had op­er­a­tions in April and May.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee, who left her job as a child­care teacher last year to take care of Raphael, said: “We tried to talk him into de­fer­ring his PSLE to next year, to give his body time to re­cu­per­ate. But he wanted to do it this year be­cause he did not want to have to take it in a new environmen­t and in a new class.”</p>
    <p>Raphael was on tar­geted ther­apy, or oral med­i­ca­tion, when he was tak­ing his pa­pers.</p>
    <p>While the med­i­ca­tion did not com­pro­mise his im­mu­nity, it caused se­vere side ef­fects such as di­ar­rhoea.</p>
    <p>He went to the toi­let six to seven times a day, up to an hour at a time. When he came out of the toi­let, he would be all sweaty and ex­hausted, said Mrs Lee.</p>
    <p>“But no mat­ter how tired and sickly he was, he wanted to go back to school be­cause he en­joyed it, and loved spend­ing time with his friends,” she added.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Mr Lee him­self was di­ag­nosed with Stage 2 colon cancer in the large in­tes­tine.</p>
    <p>“Raphael was a sen­si­ble and thought­ful boy. He was wor­ried I may not know how to deal with the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“He told his mum, ‘Why does Papa have to get cancer? Why not let me have it in his place, since I’m more ex­pe­ri­enced and have gone through chemo­ther­apy be­fore?’</p>
    <p>“I was so touched by this. I told him not to be silly. I said, ‘It’s so easy to tell you to be brave and strong – now it is time for me to lead by ex­am­ple and show you I can do it too.’”</p>
    <p>MR WIL­LIAM LEE, on his son hav­ing his arm am­pu­tated. He added that Raphael later took it in his stride, manag­ing to smile and cheer up fam­ily and friends who vis­ited him.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers at Paragon mall in Or­chard Road would some­times spot an el­derly gen­tle­man with the air of a Malay prince seated alone at PS Cafe, spoon­ing up mouth­fuls of dessert from a large bowl.</p>
    <p>To those who stopped to say hello, Mr Ameer­ali Jum­ab­hoy, al­ready in his 90s, would spot the amuse­ment in their eyes and, wav­ing a fork, would ex­plain with a straight face: “They won’t let me have it in my house, you see.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps child­hood mem­o­ries stirred in him even more fondly when he was around that part of Or­chard Road. Around the cor­ner, on Scotts Road, once stood the 80,000 sq ft prop­erty with its twin bun­ga­lows where he was raised as the son of Ra­ja­bali Jum­ab­hoy, the leader of Sin­ga­pore’s In­dian com­mu­nity in the first half of the 20th cen­tury and the first assem­bly­man for Telok Ayer con­stituency.</p>
    <p>The Jum­ab­hoys held the agency for In­dian ship­ping com­pa­nies sail­ing to Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, so had of­fices not just in Sin­ga­pore but also across the Cause­way, in Pe­nang and in Port Swet­ten­ham, now called Port Klang.</p>
    <p>It also han­dled the tick­et­ing oper­a­tion for the MV Chi­dambaram, the pas­sen­ger ship op­er­ated by Ship­ping Corp of In­dia that plied be­tween Madras, now called Chennai, and Sin­ga­pore – the route taken by thou­sands of In­dian im­mi­grants look­ing for work be­fore reg­u­lar, af­ford­able air ser­vices be­gan from the In­dian main­land.</p>
    <p>It was Ameer­ali’s idea to re­de­velop the mas­sive prop­erty as Scotts Shop­ping Cen­tre, and As­cott as Sin­ga­pore’s first pur­pose-built pro­fes­sion­ally run ser­viced apart­ments, that would help him emerge from his father’s long shadow and make his mark as a busi­ness­man in his own right. For the same rea­son, los­ing the busi­ness, Scotts Hold­ings, af­ter a bit­ter fam­ily quar­rel that ended up in court would crush him sub­se­quently.</p>
    <p>“Ameer” Jum­ab­hoy, as he was known to all, died on Tues­day morn­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, a month short of his 95th birth­day. He had been in ill health for a few weeks, first with a kid­ney in­fec­tion and then pneu­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>Till the end of his days, he dis­played an en­ergy that would have been sur­pris­ing in one even 30 years younger. At my book launch in May 2016, Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, who was the guest of hon­our, stopped to have a word with the dap­per Jum­ab­hoy pa­tri­arch and asked his age. Ninety, replied Mr Jum­ab­hoy.</p>
    <p>“You must have very good genes,” Mr Goh re­sponded, clearly im­pressed.</p>
    <p>The genes were strong, cer­tainly. His father, Ra­ja­bali, founder of the Sin­ga­pore In­dian Cham­ber of Com­merce, lived past 100. Sev­eral other rel­a­tives also proved fairly durable. Mr Ameer him­self did not look as though it was time for him to go.</p>
    <p>Born in Sin­ga­pore and ed­u­cated ini­tially at An­glo-Chi­nese School, Mr Ameer’s love for sport and sense of hu­mour left a mark on all he came in touch with. He took his O-level ex­am­i­na­tions while the Ja­panese were lit­er­ally bomb­ing the is­land. Praised for his brav­ery, he would re­spond with a wink that the truth was that he stayed only be­cause he feared his ex­am­i­na­tion re­sults would be in­val­i­dated if he did not com­plete the paper.</p>
    <p>Born into the priv­i­leged life of up­per class Mus­lim An­glophiles, Mr Ameer would say that he got his first taste of what it was to be a Bri­tish sub­ject when he and his mother, preg­nant with child, were sent to In­dia on a ship ar­ranged by In­dian in­de­pen­dence hero Jawa­har­lal Nehru to evac­u­ate In­di­ans seek­ing to es­cape the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion. The Cau­casians got the cab­ins and state rooms while the In­di­ans were put be­low deck, al­lowed on top only twice a day for ex­er­cise. This shaped his per­spec­tive, he used to say, and, upon ar­rival in Bom­bay, now Mum­bai, led him to par­tic­i­pate in Ma­hatma Gandhi’s Quit In­dia Move­ment against Bri­tish Rule, earn­ing him spells in prison.</p>
    <p>Af­ter World War II ended, he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore with a Bom­bay univer­sity de­gree and a wife, Amina, who he had met through rel­a­tives in the bustling In­dian me­trop­o­lis.</p>
    <p>The in­volve­ment in the In­dian in­de­pen­dence move­ment fired his po­lit­i­cal in­stincts in Sin­ga­pore. Mr Ameer was drawn to Mr David Mar­shall of the Work­ers’ Party, and old­timers from those days re­call some­times see­ing him mov­ing about with a ham­mer tucked into his waist band.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­shall re­mained a life­long fam­ily friend.</p>
    <p>Mr Ameer fre­quently talked of Gand­hian ideals. By that, he meant the ideals of non-vi­o­lence and look­ing at peo­ple with­out com­mu­nal lenses, val­ues that sat eas­ily on him. As for the spar­tan life­style af­fected by the Apos­tle of Non-vi­o­lence, that was not his. In­deed, horses and polo, the sport of princes, was a life­long pas­sion.</p>
    <p>He was the first Sin­ga­porean to be elected pres­i­dent of the Polo Club, serv­ing for more than a decade and us­ing his friend­ships with in­flu­en­tial peo­ple, such as the late Mr Ed­die Barker, to se­cure the club, which sits on prime land in Thom­son Road, an ex­tended lease that still has years to run.</p>
    <p>As­cott Res­i­dences got its name partly be­cause of its Scotts Road lo­ca­tion and also as a nod to the famed Bri­tish races at As­cot, with the ex­tra “t” added to avoid any copy­right is­sues that may arise.</p>
    <p>With the late Mr Tan Choo Keng, he was a co-founder of the Eques­trian Fed­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore. To­day, hun­dreds of Sin­ga­pore­ans are into rid­ing as a con­se­quence of his ef­forts and par­tic­i­pate in eques­trian events at the Asian Games and the SEA Games.</p>
    <p>While he lived and loved the good life, the com­mu­nity in­stinct was never ab­sent.</p>
    <p>Noted me­di­a­tor and ar­bi­tra­tor K. Jaya Prakash says that early in his ca­reer as a lawyer and solic­i­tor, Mr Ameer threw him a life­line by bring­ing him in as a le­gal ad­viser to the Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion, of which Mr Ameer was a found­ing mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Ameer Jum­ab­hoy was part of a very rich ta­pes­try in Sin­ga­pore, and he and his father con­trib­uted to the colour, show­ing them­selves to be dif­fer­ent,” Mr Prakash told me. “He had no prej­u­dices of any kind and he had a pres­ence. There was about him what the French call joie de vivre.”</p>
    <p>Busi­ness fig­ure Haider Sithawalla, who worked with self-help group Sinda for nearly a decade since its in­cep­tion and later served as a Sinda trustee, says he of­ten went to Mr Ameer for coun­sel and help and al­ways got a will­ing ear.</p>
    <p>At the height of Mr Ameer’s ca­reer as a busi­ness per­son­al­ity and com­mu­nity fig­ure, an in­vi­ta­tion to dine with the Jum­ab­hoys was con­sid­ered a huge event with up­wardly mo­bile In­di­ans in Sin­ga­pore. That dimmed with fate and cir­cum­stance. In 1992, Mr Ameer’s wife Amina, who had sur­vived cancer, died in the lift of a city ho­tel while she was go­ing up for a cock­tail party dressed in her favourite sari. She was 68 at the time.</p>
    <p>It was a crush­ing blow for Mr Ameer, who then took to a pe­riod of cease­less trav­el­ling to get over the loss. His chil­dren en­cour­aged him to look for an­other part­ner but he de­murred, draw­ing closer to his chil­dren in­stead, of­ten of­fer­ing to pick up the grand­chil­dren from school and drop­ping by for lunch.</p>
    <p>Then the fam­ily lost con­trol of Scotts Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple close to the Jum­ab­hoys say the feud – which pit­ted old­est son Rafiq against his father and his two broth­ers – would have been man­aged if the strong-willed Amina had lived. She would have sim­ply knocked heads un­til the mat­ter was set­tled am­i­ca­bly.</p>
    <p>It surely was some com­fort that in his last weeks, the fam­ily was in daily touch with the Kuala Lumpur-based Rafiq.</p>
    <p>Aside from Rafiq and Iqbal, Mr Ameer had a daugh­ter, Mimi, who has a fur­ni­ture busi­ness, and a son Asad, who made his ca­reer in the duty-free re­fund busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In his last decade, Mr Ameer moved into an ex­ten­sion of his son Iqbal’s house off Hol­land Road, the place de­signed to give him pri­vacy of ac­cess and room for his study and books.</p>
    <p>He loved to be at sem­i­nars and public fo­rums. Am­bas­sador-at­large Gopinath Pil­lai, who chairs the In­sti­tute of South Asian Stud­ies (ISAS), says Mr Ameer was al­ways a front-row pres­ence at ISAS sem­i­nars. At al­most ev­ery sem­i­nar, says Mr Pil­lai, he would have a ques­tion and it would be an in­tel­li­gent and prob­ing one.</p>
    <p>The late Mr Mar­shall used to say that it is im­por­tant to “leave a good per­fume be­hind when you leave the scene”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ameer Jum­ab­hoy, his acolyte and life­long friend, lived up to that ideal.</p>
    <p>COLOUR­FUL PRES­ENCE</p>
    <p>Ameer Jum­ab­hoy was part of a very rich ta­pes­try in Sin­ga­pore, and he and his father con­trib­uted to the colour, show­ing them­selves to be dif­fer­ent. He had no prej­u­dices of any kind and he had a pres­ence. There was about him what the French call joie de vivre. ’’</p>
