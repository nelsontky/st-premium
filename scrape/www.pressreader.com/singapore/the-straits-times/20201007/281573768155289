    <p>More peo­ple have been tricked by scam­mers in the first eight months of this year, with vic­tims los­ing</p>
    <p>$157 mil­lion from the 10,402 scam cases re­ported in this pe­riod. These fig­ures were al­most dou­ble those of last year, when 5,229 vic­tims lost a to­tal of $92 mil­lion in the same time pe­riod.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple have been tricked by scam­mers in the first eight months of this year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, with vic­tims los­ing $157 mil­lion from the 10,402 scam cases re­ported in this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>These fig­ures were al­most dou­ble those of last year, when 5,229 vic­tims lost $92 mil­lion in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan gave these up­dated fig­ures yes­ter­day, in re­sponse to a ques­tion from Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) on the scam sit­u­a­tion here.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the po­lice have stepped up ef­forts to fight the grow­ing scourge of scams, such as through in­creased col­lab­o­ra­tion with for­eign law en­force­ment agen­cies and set­ting up spe­cialised units in the po­lice force to com­bat scams.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the po­lice’s An­tiS­cam Cen­tre was set up in June last year and acts as a “nerve cen­tre” for in­ves­ti­gat­ing scam-re­lated crimes. In its first year of op­er­a­tion, it has frozen more than 6,100 bank ac­counts and re­cov­ered more than $21 mil­lion, added Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>The E-com­merce Fraud En­force­ment and Co­or­di­na­tion Team in the po­lice force has also ar­rested 101 e-com­merce scam­mers and solved about 2,000 e-com­merce scams since its for­ma­tion in Novem­ber 2018, he said.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce scams are the most com­mon scam crimes re­ported, fol­lowed by so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation scams and loan scams, said Mr Tan. E-com­merce scams typ­i­cally in­volve fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tions in the e-com­merce field.</p>
    <p>In so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation scams, fraud­sters of­ten pose as friends or fol­low­ers of their vic­tims to trick them into al­low­ing the scam­mers ac­cess to their per­sonal ac­counts. They then siphon money out of these ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Loan scams usu­ally in­volve scam­mers who pre­tend to be li­censed money­len­ders and re­quest de­posits from their vic­tims be­fore the loan can be dis­bursed. They then dis­ap­pear once the de­posits have been re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said he of­ten re­ceives mes­sages of­fer­ing him per­sonal loans from money­len­ders, and he has also re­ceived fraud­u­lent phone calls from scam­mers who tell him that he has a par­cel stuck at Cus­toms.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested hav­ing a web­site for Sin­ga­pore­ans to send the de­tails of such fraud­u­lent calls or mes­sages to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Tan said the sca­malert.sg site al­lows Sin­ga­pore­ans to share their ex­pe­ri­ences on the site.</p>
    <p>“To­day the po­lice work closely with the com­mu­nity to high­light what are the top five crimes in the com­mu­nity; scams are ob­vi­ously one of those that are in­creas­ing in trend, so we will take your sug­ges­tions in mind,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Ms Poh Li San (Sem­bawang GRC) on strate­gies to pro­tect se­niors from In­ter­net scams, he noted that the po­lice have also taken a more tar­geted ap­proach in their pub­lic education ef­forts and will fo­cus on those vul­ner­a­ble to scams.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the po­lice work with the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity in its Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, to help high­light to se­niors the risks and threats that could come their way, he said.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to make sure that our se­niors are pro­tected in this new cy­berspace,” said Mr Tan.</p>
