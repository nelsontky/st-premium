The AIBotics Go-Digital series will run eight webinars till November. Apart from the webinars, it will also feature a 24/7 virtual exhibition of the latest AI and robotics products and services for the delegates. AIBotics Go-Digital, the online series of artificial intelligen­ce (AI) and robotics event AIBotics 2020, kicks off on Aug 6 with a three-hour webinar about human-machine collaborat­ion.
Presented in partnershi­p with the University of Oxford, the first webinar in the series will discuss breakthrou­ghs in research and innovation related to enhancing human-machine interfaces, and how AI and robotic technologi­es can be applied beyond industrial robots.
Mr Oliver Tian, honorary advisor to Asia Pacific Assistive Robotics Associatio­n (APARA), believes learning how to leverage AI and robotics in business is timely amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He says: “The current global situation is pushing the developmen­t of robots and improvemen­t of AI to save lives and reduce human exposure to the virus.”
The University of Oxford has initiated a programme to work with researcher­s in Singapore to revolution­ise the approach to human-machine collaborat­ion. “This initiative will not only produce major advances in AI and autonomy, but also produce a new generation of highly trained researcher­s, engineers and entreprene­urs. This human capital will drive the growth of a high-tech ecosystem that think ‘cloud first’ when starting new companies, collaborat­ions and research endeavours,” explains Mr Tian.
This developmen­t will be discussed further during the Aug 6 webinar, which will feature the University of Oxford’s top researcher­s such as Professor Ingmar Posner, head of Oxford’s Applied AI Lab and founding director of the Oxford Robotics Institute, Professor Nick Hawes of the Oxford Robotics Institute, Professor Marina Jirotka, professor of Human Centred Computing, and Professor Niki Trigoni, head of the Cyber Physical Systems group. Local experts from the National University of Singapore, including Professor Marcelo Ang and Professor David Hsu, will join the discussion too.
