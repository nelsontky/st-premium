    <p>Pub­lic trans­port us­age may not re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els any time soon, a sur­vey has found. Nearly a quar­ter of the re­spon­dents in Sin­ga­pore said that they were “less will­ing” to take buses and trains since stay-home mea­sures were im­ple­mented. Another 4 per cent to 6 per cent were un­will­ing to do so at all.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port us­age may not re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els any time soon, a sur­vey has found.</p>
    <p>Nearly a quar­ter, or 22 per cent, of the 459 re­spon­dents in Sin­ga­pore said that they were “less will­ing” to take buses and trains since stay­home mea­sures were im­ple­mented. Another 4 per cent to 6 per cent were un­will­ing to do so at all.</p>
    <p>More than 6,000 peo­ple in eight coun­tries took part in the sur­vey on mo­bil­ity con­ducted be­tween June 3 and 10 by Amer­i­can man­age­ment con­sul­tancy Oliver Wy­man.</p>
    <p>The poll found that ride-hail­ing and car-shar­ing ser­vices took a heav­ier hit among peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore, with 26 per cent say­ing they were less will­ing to use these now, and another 20 per cent in­di­cat­ing they would steer clear for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>Shared ac­tive mo­bil­ity ser­vices bore the brunt of the change, with 19 per cent of re­spon­dents say­ing they were less will­ing to rent bi­cy­cles or e-scoot­ers, and another 54 per cent say­ing they would stay away for now.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, peo­ple were warm­ing up to per­sonal trans­port, with 39 per cent of those polled say­ing they were more will­ing to take to com­mut­ing by car now. Among those who had been driv­ing be­fore the cri­sis, 61 per cent were now “more will­ing to use a car”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said the at­ti­tude changes were likely to be short-lived.</p>
    <p>“Based on ex­pe­ri­ence in other cities, it looks like many com­muters are quite lim­ited in their choices,” said the as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor.</p>
    <p>“That means that many of the big changes that cities talked about in the mid­dle of the lock­downs may not ma­te­ri­alise.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Lon­don Tube users “are back to a con­sid­er­able ex­tent”, de­spite an ear­lier gov­ern­ment ad­vi­sory en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to “avoid pub­lic trans­port”.</p>
    <p>“It’s easy to talk about big changes like peo­ple giv­ing up pub­lic trans­port and turn­ing to bik­ing or driv­ing,” Prof Th­e­seira said. “But for many peo­ple, it’s sim­ply too dif­fi­cult or im­prac­ti­cal to change.”</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, op­tions are lim­ited “if you don’t own a car, you can’t af­ford to take the taxi every day, and you live too far from work to ride a bike”.</p>
    <p>“And that de­scribes a large num­ber of pub­lic trans­port com­muters.”</p>
    <p>He reck­oned that once peo­ple stop work­ing from home, pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship will largely re­vert to what it was. Hence, a 20 per cent pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship drop over the long run “is a vast over­es­ti­mate... I don’t see how it is pos­si­ble to ac­com­mo­date that 20 per cent on other tran­sit modes”.</p>
    <p>Late last month, the Trans­port Min­istry said pub­lic tran­sit rid­er­ship was around 40 per cent – up from as low as 20 per cent when the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were im­ple­mented in April.</p>
    <p>A check on Face­book cy­cling com­mu­nity pages re­vealed a num­ber of peo­ple have be­gun cy­cling to work, though.</p>
    <p>Among them is Mr Xavier Lum, who lives in Ang Mo Kio and works in Ou­tram. He now cy­cles to the MRT sta­tion in­stead of tak­ing a bus.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old biotech engi­neer said one rea­son for do­ing so was to “min­imise con­tact with crowds”. He said he might cy­cle the full dis­tance to work even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>He said that tak­ing his fold­able Bromp­ton bi­cy­cle on board the MRT was not a prob­lem, even dur­ing the morn­ing peak hours.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling ad­vo­cate Han Jok Kwang said it has clearly be­come more pop­u­lar, with bi­cy­cles now in short sup­ply in Sin­ga­pore, and “a wait­ing list world­wide”.</p>
    <p>As for those who do not cy­cle, Mr Han said: “In com­par­i­son with other ma­jor cities, I have con­fi­dence in the safety of our pub­lic trans­port.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides Sin­ga­pore, the poll cov­ered China, France, Ger­many, Italy, Spain, Bri­tain and the United States.</p>
