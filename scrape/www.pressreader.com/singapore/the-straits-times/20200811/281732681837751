    <p>Lo­cal biotech­nol­ogy firm Im­munoS­cape is not the only Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) spin-off bat­tling Covid-19. Here are three oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Re­spiree</p>
    <p>Lo­cal med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy start-up Re­spiree, founded last year, aims to save pa­tients’ lives by pre­dict­ing clin­i­cal de­te­ri­o­ra­tion early. Its core tech­nol­ogy is a sen­sor plat­form de­vel­oped at the Sin­ga­pore Bioimag­ing Con­sor­tium un­der A*Star.</p>
    <p>The plat­form com­bines car­dio-res­pi­ra­tory sens­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence an­a­lyt­ics to help pre­dict and man­age early on­set of clin­i­cal de­te­ri­o­ra­tion, such as wors­en­ing con­di­tions from res­pi­ra­tory dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The Re­spiree so­lu­tion uses two wear­able devices, one at­tached to the chest and the other clipped over a fin­ger, to mea­sure vital pa­ram­e­ters such as res­pi­ra­tory rate, breath­ing pat­tern vari­abil­ity and pulse oxime­try, or blood oxy­gen level. The data from pa­tients in iso­lated rooms is sent wire­lessly to a uni­fied dash­board in real time ev­ery five min­utes.</p>
    <p>Re­spiree has re­ceived ap­proval from the Health Sci­ences Author­ity for the use of its medtech devices in Sin­ga­pore and is in the process of se­cur­ing ap­proval from the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion to com­mer­cialise its prod­uct glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Lu­cence</p>
    <p>Founded in 2016, Lu­cence is a pre­ci­sion medicine com­pany led by on­col­o­gist Tan Min-Han.</p>
    <p>It has de­vel­oped a saliva sam­ple col­lec­tion kit that al­lows for na­sooropha­ryn­geal saliva – which is saliva in the back of the nose and throat – to be col­lected and trans­ported at room tem­per­a­ture, in­stead of in a refrigerat­ed en­vi­ron­ment, for Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>This kit, known as the Safer-Sam­ple kit, con­tains a bot­tle of fluid that can be mixed with cer­tain types of virus sam­ples at the point of col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>In­vented at A*Star’s In­sti­tute of Bio­engi­neer­ing and Nan­otech­nol­ogy, the fluid can keep the sam­ples sta­ble at room tem­per­a­ture for up to a week, while also in­ac­ti­vat­ing Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, within 45 sec­onds of sam­ple col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>MiRXES</p>
    <p>Home-grown biotech com­pany MiRXES man­u­fac­tures di­ag­nos­tic test kits for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The For­ti­tude Kit – as it is known – was co-de­vel­oped with A*Star and Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>It makes use of a process known as re­verse tran­scrip­tion-poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (RT-PCR) to de­tect the pres­ence of Sars-CoV-2 vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial in a pa­tient sam­ple.</p>
    <p>The kits have al­ready been ex­ported to more than 40 coun­tries.</p>
