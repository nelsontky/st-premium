    <p>HONG KONG Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said Bei­jing’s sweep­ing crack­down in the city she over­sees has strength­ened law and or­der and im­proved its busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“We now have a bet­ter and more sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment for busi­ness to flour­ish,” said Mrs Lam, who spoke in an in­ter­view aired on Tues­day at the Wall Street Jour­nal CEO Coun­cil Sum­mit. “Af­ter a full year of chaotic sit­u­a­tions, law and or­der has been re­stored.”</p>
    <p>When pressed about the im­pact of na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion im­posed on the city by Bei­jing in June, Mrs Lam said “a lot needs to be done to ad­dress peo­ple’s anx­i­ety”. Still, she said, busi­ness sen­ti­ment has im­proved, with in­vestors now fo­cused more on op­por­tu­ni­ties – such as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive – than on the new se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“If Hong Kong fared well in the past be­cause of our gate­way and our con­nec­tor role, I would say these two as­pects are very promis­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>The in­tro­duc­tion of the na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion led to an in­ter­na­tional out­cry and prompted US sanc­tions against Mrs Lam and other of­fi­cials. She re­cently said she was col­lect­ing “piles of cash” at home as the US mea­sures barred her from ba­sic bank­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The United States an­nounced fur­ther sanc­tions on Mon­day against 14 mem­bers of China’s leg­is­la­ture, over Bei­jing’s ac­tions in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said the se­cu­rity law ul­ti­mately pro­vides a safer and more se­cure en­vi­ron­ment for in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“We no longer see those chaotic scenes that had been dis­turb­ing and dis­rupt­ing busi­ness for a very long time since June last year,” she said. “Noth­ing is more im­por­tant than the rule of law, which has un­der­pinned Hong Kong’s suc­cess in re­cent years.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said many un­fair com­ments on Hong Kong emerg­ing re­cently showed a lack of un­der­stand­ing of the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” frame­work.</p>
    <p>It aims at pre­serv­ing as much as pos­si­ble the way of life and the sys­tems in Hong Kong, and is built on the firm foun­da­tion of Hong Kong be­ing an in­alien­able part of China, she said, stress­ing that one can­not de­vi­ate from the prin­ci­ple of “one coun­try”.</p>
    <p>De­spite the re­as­sur­ances of Mrs Lam and other of­fi­cials, Hong Kong has con­tin­ued to be rocked by po­lit­i­cal up­heaval in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Last month, China passed a res­o­lu­tion al­low­ing the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of Hong Kong law­mak­ers deemed in­suf­fi­ciently loyal – prompt­ing op­po­si­tion leg­is­la­tors to re­sign en masse. Last week, three ac­tivists in­clud­ing Joshua Wong re­ceived jail sen­tences rang­ing from seven months to 131/ months for their</p>
    <p>2 roles in a protest out­side po­lice head­quar­ters last year.</p>
