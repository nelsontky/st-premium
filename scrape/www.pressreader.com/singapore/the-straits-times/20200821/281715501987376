    <p>About 14,500 for­eign work­ers are cur­rently serv­ing out their quar­an­tine after test­ing of all work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries was com­pleted on Aug 11.</p>
    <p>“These work­ers will be tested when their quar­an­tine ends, and we ex­pect the case counts to re­main high in the com­ing days, be­fore ta­per­ing down there­after,” said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>No cases in the com­mu­nity were re­ported, said MOH in its daily up­date.</p>
    <p>Of the 68 new cases re­ported yes­ter­day, there were two im­ported cases – a Sin­ga­porean woman and a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who ar­rived from In­dia be­tween Aug 6 and 8.</p>
    <p>They were asymp­tomatic and tested pos­i­tive for the virus on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said both of them had been placed on a 14-day stay­home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and had been tested while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 66 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,099.</p>
    <p>Two clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries were closed as the dorms have been cleared by the in­ter­a­gency task force and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily com­mu­nity cases has come down from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 309 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 53,104 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 75 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 2,878 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>HIGH CASE COUNT TO TA­PER OFF</p>
    <p>These work­ers will be tested when their quar­an­tine ends, and we ex­pect the case counts to re­main high in the com­ing days, be­fore ta­per­ing down there­after.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
