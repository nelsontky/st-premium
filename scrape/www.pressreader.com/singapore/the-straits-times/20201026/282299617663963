    <p>Can milk be made in a lab­o­ra­tory in­stead of from cows or hu­mans – and can it taste just as good?</p>
    <p>Lo­cal biotech­nol­ogy start-up TurtleTree Labs cer­tainly thinks so, and it im­pressed the judges of the En­trepreneur­ship World Cup 2020 enough to walk away with the top cash prize of US$500,000 (S$679,000).</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge to dis­cover the next gen­er­a­tion of en­trepreneur­s at­tracted 175,000 par­tic­i­pants from 200 coun­tries to com­pete vir­tu­ally for the award, which was hosted by the Riyadh-based Misk Global Fo­rum last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum is the flag­ship event of a non-profit foun­da­tion set up by Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man. The win­ners were se­lected by an au­di­ence vote and a panel of world judges.</p>
    <p>TurtleTree Labs co-founder Lin Fengru called the win a “won­der­ful sur­prise”.</p>
    <p>“Win­ning this com­pe­ti­tion high­lights the im­por­tance of sus­tain­able food pro­duc­tion, and the sup­port from the com­mu­nity around such tech­nolo­gies,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We’re proud to rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore on the world stage.”</p>
    <p>Founded last year by Ms Lin, 32, and Mr Max Rye, 40, TurtleTree Labs uses cell-based meth­ods to make milk with­out the need for an­i­mals, while re­tain­ing the same com­po­si­tion and taste.</p>
    <p>Fresh cells are ex­tracted from the milk of mam­mals, in­clud­ing cow’s milk and breast milk.</p>
    <p>The cells are grown and ex­posed to a spe­cial for­mula that causes them to lac­tate. The end prod­uct, milk, is ob­tained through a fil­tra­tion process.</p>
    <p>Such cell-based foods, said Ms Lin, could be a so­lu­tion to the is­sues of heavy land use and en­ergy and water con­sump­tion that are associated with tra­di­tional dairy farm­ing. “The pop­u­la­tion of our planet is only go­ing to grow, and we need to con­tinue to in­no­vate to pro­vide bet­ter nutri­tion for ev­ery­one in a sus­tain­able fash­ion.”</p>
    <p>The global pop­u­la­tion is grow­ing by 80 mil­lion peo­ple each year. Pro­jec­tions by the United Na­tions show there will be two bil­lion more mouths to feed by 2050.</p>
    <p>This is the first time a Sin­ga­pore start-up has won the top prize in the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>TurtleTree Labs edged out two Cana­dian com­peti­tors, which came in sec­ond and third, in­clud­ing one that uses bac­te­ria to trans­form or­ganic waste into us­able ma­te­ri­als and chem­i­cals.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is on a roll, hav­ing been awarded $1 mil­lion in fund­ing by Te­masek Foun­da­tion in July af­ter win­ning this year’s edi­tion of The Live­abil­ity Chal­lenge, which seeks so­lu­tions to some of the big­gest prob­lems faced by cities in South-east Asia. It had ear­lier caught the eye of global in­vestors like Hong Kong’s al­ter­na­tive pro­tein spe­cial­ist Green Mon­day Ven­tures and raised US$3.2 mil­lion in seed fund­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s good to see this emerg­ing in­dus­try sur­round­ing novel meth­ods of food pro­duc­tion be­ing recog­nised,” Ms Lin said, adding that TurtleTree Labs has ben­e­fited from the sup­port of the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to con­tinue work­ing with them closely.”</p>
