    <p>On a re­cent week­day at the Ban­dung Zoo­log­i­cal Gar­den, a lone male munt­jac – or bark­ing deer – was snug in­side a feed trough, a sheet of cor­ru­gated steel pro­vid­ing shade from the mid­day sun.</p>
    <p>His mates gath­ered in shady patches nearby, all bliss­fully obliv­i­ous to the grim fate they had nar­rowly es­caped.</p>
    <p>In May, with its doors closed to vis­i­tors be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the 90-year-old zoo warned that it might sac­ri­fice some of its deer as food for the zoo’s rarer and more valu­able res­i­dents, in­clud­ing its Su­ma­tran tigers, Ja­vanese leop­ards and li­ons. News out­lets pounced.</p>
    <p>“As big cats go hun­gry, In­done­sia zoo con­sid­ers ‘worst case’ cull,” de­clared one Reuters head­line.</p>
    <p>“Deer may be­come tiger food, Ban­dung zoo seeks govern­ment aid,” sounded an­other in the na­tional daily Kom­pas.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, a call went up for do­na­tions, and the cull was averted.</p>
    <p>Now, ac­tivists and lo­cal busi­nesses reg­u­larly de­liver up­wards of 400 mil­lion ru­piah (S$38,000) of food, medicine and equip­ment every month to keep the zoo afloat and help un­der­write badly needed ren­o­va­tions.</p>
    <p>The flood of ba­nanas for the ele­phants, wa­ter­cress for the camels and chicken for the car­ni­vores was such that the zoo needed a new walk-in freezer and cooler to cope.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, this is a rare bit of good news and a sign that con­cerns of an­i­mal wel­fare are be­com­ing less niche.</p>
    <p>Ms Au­drey Mea­gan, 18, set up non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Zootivists when she heard the zoo might need to sac­ri­fice the deer.</p>
    <p>“We hu­mans are re­spon­si­ble for tak­ing care of the an­i­mals we put in cages for our amuse­ment,” the univer­sity stu­dent said.</p>
    <p>DANC­ING MON­KEYS</p>
    <p>To be sure, any im­prove­ment in an­i­mal wel­fare would be off a low base.</p>
    <p>When I first ar­rived in Jakarta in 2012, topeng monyet – when mon­keys are dressed to look like danc­ing dolls – was com­mon at in­ter­sec­tions.</p>
    <p>Their cap­tors would de­fang the an­i­mals – with­out anaes­thetic – and train them to ride tiny bi­cy­cles or smoke cig­a­rettes to be­guile mo­torists for tips.</p>
    <p>It is less com­mon in Jakarta now, but the prac­tice per­sists out­side the coun­try’s cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Surabaya Zoo, be­fore it was taken over by the city govern­ment in 2013, was called the “zoo of death” by the lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>A year after the city as­sumed con­trol of it from cen­tral govern­ment of­fi­cials, a young lion died after be­ing stran­gled by the ropes dan­gling in its cage.</p>
    <p>In the Ban­dung zoo, which had not had a vet­eri­nar­ian for a year, a Su­ma­tran ele­phant named Yani died of un­known causes in May 2016.</p>
    <p>The press pub­lished pho­tos of the 34-year-old pachy­derm ly­ing on the squalid ground in chains, seem­ingly cry­ing, be­fore she died.</p>
    <p>The next month, an­i­mal wel­fare ac­tivists from the non-profit Scor­pion Mon­i­tor re­leased a video taken at the Ban­dung zoo of ema­ci­ated sun bears, a nor­mally stocky species en­demic to the van­ish­ing forests of Bor­neo and Su­ma­tra, beg­ging vis­i­tors for food from their di­lap­i­dated en­clo­sure.</p>
    <p>‘CHANG­ING LIT­TLE BY LIT­TLE’</p>
    <p>One of those sun bears was Kardit.</p>
    <p>Now 38 – an­cient for the species – Kardit sniffed at my recorder, pok­ing his grey­ing muz­zle through the bars of his hold­ing pen.</p>
    <p>I had come to have a look at the zoo’s con­di­tions for my­self.</p>
    <p>Hoist­ing him­self up on his hind quar­ters, Kardit reached only my chest. His coat is thicker now and he has put on weight.</p>
    <p>If not for the Nos­fer­atu claws, which can dis­em­bowel a foe with a swipe, he would be adorable.</p>
    <p>“We’re chang­ing things lit­tle by lit­tle,” said Mr Tony Su­mam­pau, 72, who, along with his son John, has been the zoo’s new man­ager since 2017.</p>
    <p>Gone from the bears’ en­clo­sure were the mud and rub­ble de­picted in the video. It had been resur­faced with white sand.</p>
    <p>There was a raised plat­form and bal­anc­ing beams for ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Out­side, an­other bear had no time for me, tuck­ing into a young co­conut in­stead.</p>
    <p>Zoo staff are now on hand to stop vis­i­tors from toss­ing the bears crack­ers, fried peanuts and other un­healthy snacks.</p>
    <p>“It took us four months to train the vis­i­tors,” Mr Su­mam­pau said with a laugh. “Now they tell each other to stop.”</p>
    <p>The zoo is in the midst of a 6.5 bil­lion ru­piah over­haul paid for by re­ceipts from tick­ets and park­ing squir­relled away for three years.</p>
    <p>Other big changes in­clude a new African ex­hibit.</p>
    <p>Ze­bras, once up to their knees in muddy, nar­row cor­rals, now roam a 2,000 sq m dry ex­panse.</p>
    <p>They share the space with a gi­raffe on loan from Mr Su­mam­pau’s Ta­man Sa­fari an­i­mal park, which he co-founded in 1980.</p>
    <p>Next month, the li­ons will move from their stuffy, cramped en­clo­sures to roomier digs fit­ted with tufts of ele­phant grass and a Lion King-style dais for the cats to lord over vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the li­ons’ night cages, a grassy, se­cluded cor­ral shel­tered in­jured or preg­nant cats.</p>
    <p>Leafy bam­boo shoots cam­ou­flaged the metal fenc­ing. In the past, a lion need­ing care would be locked in­doors in its cage.</p>
    <p>“You have to care for the an­i­mals’ men­tal health too,” Mr Su­mam­pau said.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tor num­bers have ticked up 14 per cent to nearly 600,000 a year since 2016, de­spite ticket prices nearly dou­bling to 40,000 ru­piah in 2017.</p>
    <p>“It was so disor­gan­ised be­fore and the an­i­mals looked skinny,” said Ms Angkita, 31, who, like many In­done­sians, goes by one name.</p>
    <p>She has lived all her life near the zoo. “I started vis­it­ing again two years ago when I saw so­cial me­dia posts and news that said the zoo was safer for the an­i­mals.”</p>
    <p>‘PEO­PLE WILL COME’</p>
    <p>In the days be­fore man­age­ment changed hands, zoo staff let friends in for free and worked side hus­tles with pri­vate ven­dors, who would ped­dle toys, iced treats and mats for pic­nics in front of the primate cages, in ex­change for kick­backs.</p>
    <p>The Su­mam­paus agreed to man­age the zoo for the own­ers to fend off its col­lapse.</p>
    <p>Ta­man Sa­fari In­done­sia notched up roughly 3.5 mil­lion vis­i­tors across its five parks last year.</p>
    <p>They were wor­ried about the knock-on ef­fects on their own busi­ness if Ban­dung zoo were closed. “If this zoo fails, it’s a black mark against the whole</p>
    <p>In­done­sian zoo seg­ment,” the younger Mr Su­mam­pau said.</p>
    <p>Dusk came and I could hear the li­ons grunt in their night cages.</p>
    <p>I gath­ered my things to make my way to board the train back to Jakarta. As the men saw me off, the se­nior Mr Su­mam­pau said he was op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>An Asian ex­hibit for the Su­ma­tran tigers and ele­phants is slated for next year.</p>
    <p>“I tell the staff, ‘Just be­lieve me’,” he said. “When you do hard work, peo­ple will come.”</p>
