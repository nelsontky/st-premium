    <p>Bri­tish engi­neer­ing com­pany Dyson is cut­ting 900 jobs glob­ally due to the im­pact of the pan­demic on con­sumer de­mand, it said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that 16 po­si­tions in Sin­ga­pore – the site of the com­pany’s global head­quar­ters – are af­fected.</p>
    <p>Dyson em­ploys about 1,200 peo­ple here, in­clud­ing 350 en­gi­neers and sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the cuts – 600 po­si­tions – are in Bri­tain, mainly in re­tail and cus­tomer ser­vice. The firm said it is look­ing to re­de­ploy work­ers to al­ter­na­tive roles where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Dyson, best known for its bag­less vac­uum clean­ers and hairdry­ers, em­ploys about 14,000 peo­ple around the world with 4,000 or so in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that work on its new head­quar­ters at St J ames Power Sta­tion is on­go­ing but de­layed due to the pan­demic and there are no changes to its ex­pan­sion plan.</p>
    <p>Dyson’s three demo stores – at Fu­nan, West­gate and Capi­tol Sin­ga­pore – will also not be af­fected.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said last year that it has been as­sem­bling new re­search teams in Sin­ga­pore, one spe­cial­is­ing in ar­eas such as ma­chine learn­ing, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>It added then that it in­tends to more than dou­ble its re­search and de­vel­op­ment head­count in Sin­ga­pore over the next five years.</p>
    <p>Dyson aban­doned plans to make elec­tric ve­hi­cles last year, which had in­cluded build­ing a plant here, as it was not “com­mer­cially vi­able”.</p>
    <p>It also de­vel­oped a med­i­cal ven­ti­la­tor from scratch ear­lier this year that uses mo­tors made in Sin­ga­pore’s ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing plant in Pi­o­neer Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>Dyson’s state­ment on Thurs­day noted that the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated changes in con­sumer be­hav­iour, prompt­ing changes in how the com­pany en­gages with cus­tomers and sells its prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“We are evolv­ing our or­gan­i­sa­tion and re­flect­ing these changes to make us faster, more ag­ile, and bet­ter able to grow sus­tain­ably,” it said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has not fur­loughed any em­ploy­ees or drawn on pub­lic funds to sup­port jobs any­where in the world dur­ing this pe­riod, it added.</p>
