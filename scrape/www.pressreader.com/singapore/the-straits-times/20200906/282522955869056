    <p>One day, on my way home from pri­mary school, I en­coun­tered a half-naked woman wan­der­ing around my neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Her wrin­kled, sag­ging breasts hung out, for all who cared to look. She smiled at me, with­out a shred of self-con­scious­ness. I quickly took her hand, guided her into the lift – ush­er­ing my grand­mother home.</p>
    <p>Just nine years old at the time, my face and eyes burned with em­bar­rass­ment. At the time, I thought Ah Ma was just be­ing wil­ful, walk­ing around half-naked to spite my mum. She would com­plain to any­one who would lis­ten, about how her daugh­ter-in-law beat her, didn’t feed her and gen­er­ally ill-treated her, in loud and colour­ful Hokkien.</p>
    <p>At the time, mum laughed it off, say­ing Ah Ma was go­ing through her “sec­ond child­hood” .</p>
    <p>Now I know bet­ter – Ah Ma suf­fered from de­men­tia. The for­get­ful­ness, dif­fi­culty per­form­ing rou­tine tasks, get­ting lost, and wild swings in moods and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>While mum did lose her tem­per at Ah Ma’s an­tics some­times, I never saw her lay a fin­ger on Ah Ma or ill-treat her.</p>
    <p>As the dis­ease rav­aged her mind and body, Ah Ma’s love for me never wa­vered. While she could swing from a lov­ing, dot­ing grand­mother to a violently ag­gres­sive adult-child with lit­tle no­tice, she never hurt me.</p>
    <p>She al­ways had a smile for me and called me by my Hokkien name, even when she could barely make me out from her hos­pi­tal bed.</p>
    <p>The woman who raised me un­til I was five years old never for­got me, but it pained me to see how she pro­gres­sively for­got many in the fam­ily, even sev­eral of her own chil­dren. I watched the light of her mind go out slowly, one day at a time.</p>
    <p>Af­ter my father passed away when I was nine, my mother took on the task of be­ing the pri­mary care­giver to my pa­ter­nal grand­mother as her health de­clined, with some respite given by my father’s third brother and his wife.</p>
    <p>Af­ter los­ing her el­dest son, my grand­mother did not want to end up in an old folk’s home. Her heart­break at hav­ing out­lived her el­dest son was sur­passed only by her fear of spend­ing her re­main­ing days in an in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>I re­cently fin­ished the book The Soul Of Care: The Moral Ed­u­ca­tion Of A Hus­band And A Doc­tor, by renowned Har­vard psy­chi­a­trist and an­thro­pol­o­gist Arthur Klein­man.</p>
    <p>The book made me con­front my mem­o­ries of how my mother cared for Ah Ma in her fi­nal years.</p>
    <p>Klein­man writes about car­ing for his wife Joan over 10 years, as she strug­gled with early on­set Alzheimer’s dis­ease. He writes: “To be present and fo­cused ev­ery day, ev­ery hour, ev­ery minute, gave me a central pur­pose in liv­ing. It was my emo­tional and moral ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Read­ing the book, I re­alised that the emo­tional and moral ed­u­ca­tion of car­ing for Ah Ma in her twi­light years was not just for the care­giver, my mum, but also for the by­standers in the process – me.</p>
    <p>It re­minds me of the TV com­mer­cial on fil­ial piety de­vel­oped by the then Min­istry of Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment, Youth and Sports a decade ago. It is ti­tled Father And Son, and its tagline is: “How one gen­er­a­tion loves, the next gen­er­a­tion learns”.</p>
    <p>Still avail­able on YouTube, it re­counts how an ir­ri­ta­ble granny comes to live with her son. It is shot from the per­spec­tive of the grand­son, as he sees first-hand the im­por­tance of re­spect­ing, hon­our­ing and lov­ing his par­ents, through the best and worst of times. The video ends with the grand­son watch­ing as his father tends to grandma dur­ing her last hours at the hos­pi­tal, croon­ing to her the same Hokkien song that she sang to com­fort him when he burned up with fever as a child.</p>
    <p>Klein­man made the de­ci­sion to take care of his wife by him­self in their fam­ily home. Over much of the 10 years of his wife’s de­cline, he sol­diered on, shoul­der­ing the pri­mary care­giv­ing tasks by him­self, with only a brief respite from his kids. He con­tin­ued to work at Har­vard Univer­sity dur­ing the day, when a home health­care aide came to watch over his wife.</p>
    <p>He writes in his book: “Care­giv­ing for the frail elderly, vul­ner­a­ble chil­dren, the in­firm and chron­i­cally dis­abled in­volves pro­vid­ing phys­i­cal acts of help (bathing, feed­ing, ex­er­cis­ing, some­times just get­ting from one place to another), emo­tional in­sight and sup­port, and moral sol­i­dar­ity. As of­ten as not, the most im­por­tant thing of­fered by a care­giver is sim­ply their com­plete pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>Mum was al­ways com­pletely present in the care of Ah Ma. Even though Ah Ma was not her birth mother, she sol­diered on with­out a grum­ble. This, de­spite the fact that Ah Ma’s son had dis­ap­pointed mum by dying at a young age, leav­ing be­hind two young and pre­co­cious kids to raise on her pri­mary school teacher’s salary. Be­tween doc­tor’s ap­point­ments for Ah Ma’s de­clin­ing men­tal state, keep­ing house, cook­ing and her teach­ing du­ties, my mother hardly had any time for her­self.</p>
    <p>There was no do­mes­tic helper to pro­vide any form of re­lief, and my sis­ter and I were too young to be of help. Mum used to say that her only in­dul­gence was to take an af­ter­noon nap ev­ery now and again.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, I would see her at the point of com­plete ex­haus­tion. There were many low points in the years that she took care of Ah Ma. One that stands out in my mem­ory is when mum came home to an apart­ment full of fae­ces. The door opened to Ah Ma play­ing with and eat­ing her own waste. The whole HDB apart­ment was cov­ered in it. In­deed, in deal­ing with Ah Ma’s de­men­tia, shit lit­er­ally hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Some 30 years af­ter the in­ci­dent, I en­coun­tered a Mayo Hos­pi­tal study, which found out that co­propha­gia – eat­ing one’s own fae­ces – is as­so­ci­ated with a wide range of neu­ropsy­chi­atric dis­or­ders, par­tic­u­larly neu­rode­gen­er­a­tive de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Would it have helped my mum to know that? I don’t think it would have mat­tered.</p>
    <p>Be­ing as­sailed by the scene and the smell, I watched her break down. She cried un­con­trol­lably and in­con­solably. Sens­ing her help­less­ness, my sis­ter and I hugged her, not know­ing what to do. Grad­u­ally, she picked her­self up and started clean­ing up Ah Ma and the apart­ment.</p>
    <p>As Klein­man put it: “As bru­tally chal­leng­ing as real care was, the ex­pe­ri­ence of those years was, for me, ut­terly re­demp­tive.”</p>
    <p>When mum got mar­ried, she was a spoilt daugh­ter who grew up in a semi-de­tached prop­erty off Or­chard Road. She never learnt to cook or do house­hold chores be­cause the ser­vants took care of it. She mar­ried a fel­low school teacher who came from a hum­ble back­ground and left her gilded life to live in a HDB flat.</p>
    <p>Af­ter los­ing my father, mum worked like a dog to take care of Ah Ma and her two kids. She of­ten col­lapsed, exhausted, into bed for a few short hours be­fore the work cycle started all over again.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber of­ten see­ing mum bro­ken and help­less, strug­gling through each episode, yet tap­ping deep inner re­sources to get up and move on, even­tu­ally rais­ing a lawyer and a chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>What amazes me is that when mum thinks back to the time she looked af­ter Ah Ma, she does not have any rec­ol­lec­tion of the hard times, or even the in­ci­dent with the fae­ces. Mum re­mem­bers only Ah Ma’s bub­bly per­son­al­ity, her gift of hos­pi­tal­ity and her abil­ity to make strangers feel com­fort­able, mere min­utes af­ter meeting them. It shows how the mind adapts and heals with the pas­sage of time.</p>
    <p>In ret­ro­spect, the care­giv­ing jour­ney with Ah Ma re­sulted in the re­demp­tion of not just the care­giver, but also the child by­stander. In­deed, “how one gen­er­a­tion loves, the next gen­er­a­tion learns”.</p>
