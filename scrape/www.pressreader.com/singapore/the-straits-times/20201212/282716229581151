    <p>1. The lo­co­mo­tive and ten­der</p>
    <p>The lo­co­mo­tive with its ten­der, a trail­ing ve­hi­cle typ­i­cally at­tached to a steam lo­co­mo­tive to carry fuel and wa­ter, was con­structed in 1862. Loaned by Ajecta, the French as­so­ci­a­tion for re­con­di­tion­ing her­itage trains, the lo­co­mo­tive and two cars – the Pull­man and Four­gon, which were en­gi­neered in the 1930s – are con­sid­ered France’s na­tional trea­sures.</p>
    <p>Ajecta, or The Youth As­so­ci­a­tion for the Main­te­nance and Preser­va­tion of Old Trains, is funded by grants from the pri­vate sec­tor and the French gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>2. Board­ing plat­form fa­cade</p>
    <p>Through a re­con­sti­tuted train plat­form, vis­i­tors can re­live the ex­cite­ment of gath­er­ing at the train plat­form in Paris in the late 1800s, when the Ori­ent Ex­press would pull up at the sta­tion to be­gin its jour­ney to Con­stantino­ple (modern-day Is­tan­bul) in Turkey.</p>
    <p>The 1889 re­turn jour­ney took four days, with stopovers in Mu­nich, Bu­dapest and Bel­grade.</p>
    <p>3. The Pull­man car­riage</p>
    <p>The 1920 car­riage weighs around 60 tonnes and needed the agree­ment of Gar­dens by the Bay to be set up at the site be­cause of the com­plex­ity of han­dling and ship­ping to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Th­ese car­riages were built from the late 1800s based on a con­cept pi­o­neered in the United States by Amer­i­can rail­roader Ge­orge Pull­man. Pull­man trains of­fered more lux­u­ri­ous ac­com­mo­da­tion than or­di­nary main­line trains.</p>
    <p>This car­riage is on loan from Ajecta. It show­cases mem­o­ra­bilia that give clues to the op­u­lent life­styles of the dig­ni­taries and celebri­ties who boarded the Ori­ent Ex­press, such as Amer­ica-born French en­ter­tainer Josephine Baker, nov­el­ist Gra­ham Greene, cel­e­brated Ro­ma­nian so­cialite and style icon Princess Marthe Bibesco and Dutch ex­otic dancer and cour­te­san Mata Hari, con­victed of be­ing a spy for Ger­many dur­ing World War I.</p>
    <p>4. The Four­gon car­riage</p>
    <p>“Four­gon” refers to a long cov­ered wagon for car­ry­ing bag­gage, goods or mil­i­tary sup­plies. This car, which weighs 40.5 tonnes, will show­case mem­o­ra­bilia and the works of the late English writer Agatha Christie. One of her best-known books is the 1934 novel Mur­der On The Ori­ent Ex­press, which in­spired sev­eral film and tele­vi­sion adap­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>A fre­quent trav­eller on the Ori­ent Ex­press, she wrote more than 60 mys­tery nov­els, mostly cen­tred on fic­tional de­tec­tives, Her­cule Poirot and Miss Marple.</p>
    <p>5. The mu­seum</p>
    <p>This pop-up at­trac­tion re­traces the ro­man­tic era of lux­ury travel via a wide col­lec­tion of pieces from a by­gone era, such as posters, menus, crock­ery, cut­lery, suit­cases, stained-glass win­dows and fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>Large dis­plays of trunks ad­dress so­cial, cul­tural and tech­ni­cal themes linked to the ad­ven­tures of the Ori­ent Ex­press.</p>
    <p>The ex­hibits are cu­rated to evoke scenic stopovers on its route such as Lon­don, Paris, Venice, Is­tan­bul, Aleppo, Da­m­as­cus, Bagh­dad, Cairo, Luxor and Aswan.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can also watch doc­u­men­taries and film clips that show the lit­er­ary and cin­e­matic legacy of the Ori­ent Ex­press.</p>
    <p>6. The sou­venir shop</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can buy cus­tom-made me­men­toes spe­cially crafted for the ex­hi­bi­tion such as lug­gage tags, minia­ture train mod­els, tea cups and note­books from the pop-up shop in the tented area.</p>
    <p>Prices start at $1.50 for a post­card to about $100 for a silk scarf.</p>
    <p>7. Ori­ent Ex­press Road Cafe</p>
    <p>Stop for a breather here and sam­ple heady cof­fee blends that were dis­cov­ered and made fa­mous dur­ing the many stopovers on the orig­i­nal 19th-cen­tury Ori­ent Ex­press route. The cafe serves light snacks and pas­tries start­ing at $7 and bev­er­ages priced from $3.</p>
    <p>8. Art Deco in­te­ri­ors</p>
    <p>El­e­ments of the Art Deco cre­ations of French fur­ni­ture de­signer and dec­o­ra­tor Rene Prou and master of sculpted glass and crys­tal works Rene Lalique are show­cased in the mu­seum area, along with over 300 other arte­facts from Paris.</p>
    <p>Prou, who dab­bled in de­sign­ing wrought-iron fur­ni­ture in 1929, went on to de­sign the Ori­ent Ex­press’ salon train car­riages in the 1930s, cre­at­ing in­tri­cate mar­quetry and other dec­o­ra­tive art pieces to add to the train’s art nou­veau-meets- con­tem­po­rary vibe.</p>
    <p>His ac­claimed con­tem­po­rary, Lalique, cre­ated ar­chi­tec­tural glass pan­els with sculpted male and fe­male nudes, us­ing a spe­cial molten glass tech­nique he per­fected for the in­te­rior pan­els in the Ori­ent Ex­press.</p>
    <p>9. Pop-up restau­rant with Yan­nick Al­leno</p>
    <p>The restau­rant opens with high tea ses­sions from to­day. The ro­mance of the 19th-cen­tury gourmet din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence on board the Ori­ent Ex­press will be recre­ated in a replica of a din­ing car­riage un­der the tented area by three-Miche­lin-starred chef Yan­nick Al­leno (left), who worked with the or­gan­is­ers in 2014 on the in­au­gu­ral ex­hi­bi­tion pop-up in Paris.</p>
    <p>Brunch, lunch and din­ner will be avail­able be­fore Christ­mas, with de­tails to be given at a later date.</p>
    <p>Make reser­va­tions for high tea at www.ori­en­t­ex­pres­sex­hi­bi­tion.com. Prices for lunch (not avail­able on Sun­days) start at $188, while din­ner costs from $298 (first seat­ing at 6pm) and</p>
    <p>$398 (sec­ond seat­ing at 8pm).</p>
    <p>There are also high teas and Sun­day brunches, with prices start­ing at $78 and</p>
    <p>$250 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Bev­er­ages, wines and spir­its are charged sep­a­rately.</p>
