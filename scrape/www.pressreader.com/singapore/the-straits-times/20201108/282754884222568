    <p>LON­DON • Bruno Fer­nan­des has urged his Manch­ester United team­mates to all be­come lead­ers, as the mid­fielder in­spired a fight­back at Ever­ton yes­ter­day with two goals and an as­sist for Edin­son Ca­vani in a 3-1 win to ease the pres­sure on man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>United have failed to win in four games at home in the Pre­mier League this sea­son and there were ques­tions over Sol­sk­jaer’s fu­ture after the mid­week 2-1 de­feat by Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Fer­nan­des, though, be­lieved the Red Devils would al­ways have a chance to bounce back as long as they had faith in them­selves.</p>
    <p>“We know our qual­ity. We worked hard for the game,” in­sisted the Por­tuguese on BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“It was dif­fi­cult to re­cover after the (Basak­se­hir) game. This was the mo­ment to do some­thing in this game and we did it.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one needs to be a leader. Some play­ers need to be a mood leader – don’t need to talk too much but do the right things – and oth­ers need to speak more to feel more part of the game.</p>
    <p>“But at the end of the game the three points is for ev­ery­one not just for one player.”</p>
    <p>The loss was the third straight de</p>
    <p>feat for Carlo Ancelotti’s side while United have now won seven suc­ces­sive away league games. This equals the long­est away win­ning run in the club’s his­tory set by Alex Fer­gu­son’s team be­tween April-Au­gust 1993.</p>
    <p>United started slowly though as Ever­ton took the lead in the 19th minute with Brazil­ian winger Bernard’s low drive through Aaron Wan-Bis­saka’s legs squeez­ing in the bot­tom cor­ner.</p>
    <p>But six min­utes later, the vis­i­tors drew level when Fer­nan­des met a Luke Shaw cross from the left with a per­fectly an­gled header.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton left-back Lu­cas Digne then struck the post from a promis­ing po­si­tion but United were grow­ing into the game and it was no sur­prise when they took the lead.</p>
    <p>Fer­nan­des floated in a cross from the left which Mar­cus Rash­ford just missed by a whisker but the ball went in off the post.</p>
    <p>Sub­sti­tute Ca­vani added the third in stop­page time, fin­ish­ing off a counter-at­tack led by Fer­nan­des for his first goal since join­ing the club on dead­line day last month.</p>
    <p>De­spite the three points, Sol­sk­jaer was un­happy with the league’s sched­ul­ing of this match.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian told BT Sport: “We were set up to fail. The kick­off time set us up to fail.</p>
    <p>“We have been to Turkey, played loads of games this sea­son al­ready, we got back Thurs­day morn­ing and we are play­ing Satur­day lunchtime, it’s an ab­so­lute sham­bles.</p>
    <p>“The au­thor­i­ties set us up to fail. We’ve had enough of that. Play­ers this sea­son, in these times, a pan­demic, men­tally and phys­i­cally, it’s drain­ing.</p>
    <p>“Let us play on a Sun­day, there’s an in­ter­na­tional break after this, it’s a joke.”</p>
    <p>Ancelotti, mean­while, nar­rowed in on his side’s de­fen­sive mis­takes.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem was that after we scored we were not able to de­fend well, and they took ad­van­tage,” the Ital­ian said.</p>
    <p>“They were able to score eas­ily. We said be­fore the game we had to de­fend bet­ter and we did not de­fend good enough. We were slow at the back, we have to im­prove.”</p>
