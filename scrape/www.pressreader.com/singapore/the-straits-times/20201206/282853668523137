    <p>Where: 01-468, Block 69 Be­dok South Av­enue 3 Open: 8.30am to 8.30pm</p>
    <p>To taste steamed egg that is com­pa­ra­ble to the chawan­mushi at Ja­panese eater­ies, you have to be there when it is cooked by chef Chong Son Keong.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old, who goes by the nick­name Ah Boy, does an ex­cep­tional steamed egg ($0.60 a serv­ing with rice; $2 for sep­a­rate serv­ing) that is jig­gly in tex­ture and smooth on the sur­face.</p>
    <p>Ah Boy is not as adept at cook­ing chicken curry ($1.20 a serv­ing; $3 for a sep­a­rate serv­ing), though. He leaves out the shal­lots and adds too much wa­ter.</p>
    <p>But on an­other visit, the same dish cooked by the other chef, Mr Xie Kia Lum, 26, turns out to be so ad­dic­tively aro­matic, I wish I had a French loaf to dip in the gravy.</p>
    <p>But when it comes to t he steamed egg, Mr Xie’s ver­sion turns out typ­i­cally pock­marked due to the use of a high heat fire.</p>
    <p>Lady’s fin­gers with Chi­nese sausage ($0.80 a serv­ing; $2 for a sep­a­rate serv­ing) are a play of tex­tures– the sticky crunch­i­ness from the lady’s fin­gers goes well with the thin and tasty slices of Chi­nese sausage.</p>
    <p>The stir-fried brin­jal and lady’s fin­gers ($0.80 a serv­ing; $2 for sep­a­rate serv­ing) are also flavour­some – the large chunks of ten­der juicy brin­jal soak up the sea­son­ing of light soya sauce and oys­ter sauce.</p>
    <p>The tasty fried chicken chop ($2 a piece and for sep­a­rate serv­ing) is ex­pertly mar­i­nated with salt, gar­lic wa­ter and corn­starch.</p>
    <p>But, as a plain flour-based bat­ter is used, the fried bone­less chicken thigh is not as crispy as those at other stalls which use corn­flour in their bat­ter.</p>
    <p>The chicken curry is ready by 9.45am, but the potato is still a lit­tle un­der­cooked. The potato is de­lib­er­ately left to con­tinue cook­ing over resid­ual heat so it does not turn mushy by lunchtime.</p>
    <p>The best times to go are at 11am and 5pm, when all the dishes have been cooked and are on dis­play.</p>
