    <p>Prop­er­tyGuru Group has raised an­other $300 mil­lion from global in­vest­ment gi­ants TPG Cap­i­tal and KKR, both of which are ex­ist­ing in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The fund­ing will ac­cel­er­ate the prop­erty tech­nol­ogy company’s growth across South-east Asia as it “ramps up its in­vest­ment to meet the rapidly evolv­ing needs in the prop­erty ecosys­tem”, the firm said in a media release yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Hari V. Kr­ish­nan said: “The ad­di­tional in­vest­ments from TPG and KKR will en­able us to con­tinue build­ing South-east Asia’s prop­erty trust plat­form and ac­cel­er­ate our mo­men­tum in key mar­kets like Malaysia and Viet­nam.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We help prop­erty seek­ers ‘Find.Fi­nance.Own’ their home and these new in­vest­ments will ac­cel­er­ate the growth plans we have iden­ti­fied as more con­sumers and cus­tomers move to­wards dig­i­tal so­lu­tions for prop­erty buy­ing and sell­ing.”</p>
    <p>The company scrapped plans for an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing in Aus­tralia last year, cit­ing mar­ket volatil­ity. It was plan­ning to raise as much as A$380.2 mil­lion (S$380.1 mil­lion) in the list­ing.</p>
    <p>Prop­er­tyGuru added that the in­vest­ment comes at “an ex­tra­or­di­nary time”.</p>
    <p>The company has seen a 24 per cent year-on-year rev­enue growth and con­tin­ues to lead in South-east Asia with a 57 per cent mar­ket share, it said.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2007, Prop­er­tyGuru is based in Sin­ga­pore and also op­er­ates in Viet­nam, Thai­land, Malaysia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Its chair­man Olivier Lim said: “We have scaled rapidly across South-east Asia by an­tic­i­pat­ing and ad­dress­ing con­sumer needs with a data-driven strat­egy, un­der­pinned by a tal­ented team of ‘gu­rus’.</p>
    <p>“This year, amidst the chang­ing busi­ness re­al­i­ties, the demon­stra­ble strength of our plat­forms has so­lid­i­fied our rel­a­tive mar­ket lead­er­ship and pro­vides new op­por­tu­ni­ties to ac­cel­er­ate both or­ganic and in­or­ganic growth with new in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>The company in­tends to ex­pand Prop­er­tyGuru Fi­nance, a mort­gage mar­ket­place launched this year, and Prop­er­tyGuru FastKey, an endto-end sales en­able­ment so­lu­tion for prop­erty de­vel­op­ers. It also seeks to im­prove its data ca­pa­bil­i­ties to serve home buy­ers across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>One of the newer fea­tures in Prop­er­tyGuru FastKey is what is dubbed the Sto­ry­Teller, which al­lows 360-de­gree walk-throughs of a project, its units and the sur­round­ing cityscape.</p>
    <p>It lets prop­erty de­vel­op­ers be­gin mar­ket­ing their projects even be­fore the con­struc­tion of the phys­i­cal sales gal­leries and show-flats.</p>
