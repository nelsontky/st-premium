    <p>WELLING­TON • A white su­prem­a­cist, who killed 51 peo­ple at two mosques in New Zealand last year, watched with­out emo­tion yes­ter­day as rel­a­tives of his vic­tims re­counted the hor­ror of a mas­sacre that prose­cu­tors said he care­fully planned to cause max­i­mum car­nage.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian na­tional Bren­ton Tar­rant, 29, has pleaded guilty to 51 mur­ders, 40 at­tempted mur­ders and one charge of com­mit­ting a ter­ror­ist act dur­ing the shoot­ing ram­page in the city of Christchur­ch which he livestream­ed on Face­book.</p>
    <p>He could be the first per­son in New Zealand to re­ceive a term of life in prison with­out pa­role, when a High Court judge sen­tences him later this week for car­ry­ing out the dead­li­est shoot­ing in the coun­try’s his­tory on March 15 last year.</p>
    <p>Dressed in grey prison clothes, Tar­rant looked at those de­liv­er­ing vic­tim im­pact state­ments, in­clud­ing the mother of Mr Ata Elayyan, the 33-year-old goal­keeper for the New Zealand fut­sal team who was slain in the Al Noor mosque.</p>
    <p>Ms Maysoon Salama said she con­stantly won­dered what her son was think­ing i n his last mo­ments “armed only with his courage”.</p>
    <p>“I can’t for­give you... you gave your­self the author­ity to take the souls of 51 peo­ple. Our only crime in your eyes is that we are Mus­lims,” she said.</p>
    <p>“You killed your own hu­man­ity and I don’t think the world will for­give you for your hor­ri­ble crime. May you get the sever­est pun­ish­ment for your evil act in this life, and hereafter.”</p>
    <p>Mr Elayyan was near the back of the mosque, while his fa­ther, near the front, sur­vived the at­tack de­spite be­ing shot in the head and shoul­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Ga­mal Fouda, imam of Al Noor mosque, told Tar­rant that he was “mis­guided and mis­led”.</p>
    <p>“I can say to the fam­ily of the ter­ror­ist that they have lost a son and we have lost many from our com­mu­nity too,” Mr Fouda said. “I re­spect them be­cause they are suf­fer­ing as we are.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Hamimah Tuyan is one of 31 women wid­owed in the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Dr Tuyan’s Turk­ish hus­band Zek­eriya, a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, was the last per­son to die from the at­tack, af­ter fight­ing for his life for 48 days in the in­ten­sive care unit with her by his side.</p>
    <p>Mr Tuyan, who was in his 40s and worked in Christchur­ch, was shot at the Al Noor mosque, where he had gone for Fri­day prayers.</p>
    <p>Dr Tuyan told Ra­dio New Zealand (RNZ) on Sun­day that she pon­dered over whether she would be in­dulging the gun­man by read­ing to the court the ef­fects of his at­tack.</p>
    <p>Would it “fan his nar­cis­sism by giv­ing him the sat­is­fac­tion of lis­ten­ing to my im­pact state­ments, and play­ing into his agenda”, she said.</p>
    <p>“But sen­tenc­ing is an im­por­tant part of the jus­tice process, and re­ally it’s up to me to use this op­por­tu­nity to fit my agenda – my hus­band is not here to speak for him­self, so I am his voice. I am also my chil­dren’s voice,” she said, re­fer­ring to her two boys.</p>
    <p>“I also wanted to tell the judge in my own way and ap­peal to him di­rectly on the pun­ish­ment that I think this evil mur­derer de­serves. My hus­band would have done the same for me. Of course I hope... my boys will look back on this day and they will be proud of their mum,” she told RNZ.</p>
    <p>Another Sin­ga­porean, Mr Rashid Omar, lost his 24-year-old son Tariq Rashid Omar, who was a cit­i­zen of New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Tar­rant will be al­lowed to speak at some point dur­ing the hear­ings, al­though Jus­tice Cameron Man­der has pow­ers to en­sure the High Court is not used as a plat­form for ex­trem­ist ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks prompted a global out­pour­ing of grief as well as scrutiny of so­cial me­dia plat­forms af­ter the then 28-year-old live-streamed the shoot­ings shortly af­ter up­load­ing a man­i­festo.</p>
    <p>Crown pros­e­cu­tor Barn­aby Hawes said Tar­rant told po­lice that he wanted to cre­ate fear among the small Mus­lim mi­nor­ity in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Tar­rant had also ex­pressed re­gret for not tak­ing more lives and re­vealed that he had in­tended to burn down the Al Noor mosque af­ter the shoot­ings, Mr Hawes said.</p>
    <p>“He in­tended to in­stil fear into those he de­scribed as in­vaders, in­clud­ing the Mus­lim pop­u­la­tion or more gen­er­ally non-Euro­pean im­mi­grants.”</p>
    <p>While most of Tar­rant’s vic­tims were at Al Noor mosque, he killed seven peo­ple at a sec­ond mosque be­fore be­ing de­tained en route to a third.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Man­der said he would not sen­tence Tar­rant be­fore Thurs­day so that sur­vivors and fam­ily mem­bers of vic­tims had an op­por­tu­nity to ad­dress the court.</p>
