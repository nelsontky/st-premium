    <p>While some pre-school­ers re­sist going to bed, three-year-old Si­enna Jamie Loi loves bed­time. The ear­lier, the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause she gets to read with her par­ents be­fore she sleeps.</p>
    <p>Her mother – tele­vi­sion sports pre­sen­ter and host Kelly Latimer – says: “If she goes to bed at 7 o’clock, she gets three bed­time sto­ries. If she goes to bed at 7.30, she gets two sto­ries. And if she goes to bed at eight o’clock, she gets only one story. So she’s quite highly mo­ti­vated to go to bed ear­lier.”</p>
    <p>Latimer, 33, re­calls read­ing with Si­enna from “the day she was born”, start­ing with black-and­white flash cards and vis­ually ap­peal­ing pic­ture books.</p>
    <p>Be­sides in­tro­duc­ing the habit from a young age, she be­lieves her daugh­ter got hooked on books be­cause she does not just read words off a page. She in­ter­acts with Si­enna and even acts out the char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>One of Si­enna’s favourite books is based on an­i­mated series The Oc­to­nauts (2010 to present).</p>
    <p>“I do my best to im­i­tate the ac­cent of each char­ac­ter so she ac­tu­ally feels like she’s al­most watch­ing the show,” Latimer says.</p>
    <p>She learnt th­ese tricks from her father, who made read­ing a big part of her evening rou­tine. When Latimer started recog­nis­ing let­ters, he would read a line and get her to do the next.</p>
    <p>“It be­came him read­ing a page and then I would read a page. Then I got fed up with him read­ing so slowly that I just took the book and started read­ing it my­self,” says Latimer, who is ex­pect­ing her se­cond child, a boy, in March.</p>
    <p>Her TV work has been put on hold. Latimer has been keep­ing her­self busy in the kitchen since Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>She is sell­ing sauces made from her fam­ily’s recipes, from Ren Xi X Os au ce( named af­ter her mother) to ba­con jam to whiskey salted caramel and even a spe­cial sauce for Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>She says her on­line busi­ness Kelly’s Kitchen (kellyskitc­hen.sg) is a trib­ute to her her­itage. Her mother is Sin­ga­porean Chi­nese and her father is from the United King­dom, where she was born.</p>
    <p>“It seems like a crazy thing to em­bark on while preg­nant as it has me on my feet for long hours, but I love it,” she says.</p>
    <p>Like her daugh­ter, she l ooks for­ward to wind­ing down every night with books.</p>
    <p>“We get very caught up in our day-to-day lives,” she says. “I feel like Si­enna, es­pe­cially, sees her bed­time sto­ries as a way for ev­ery­one to come to­gether.”</p>
