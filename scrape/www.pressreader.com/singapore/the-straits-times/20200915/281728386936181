    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic will hit the most vul­ner­a­ble in so­ci­ety and dis­ad­van­tage the coun­tries al­ready lag­ging be­hind, Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the rise in fe­male labour force par­tic­i­pa­tion could be set back, while a suc­cess­ful vac­cine could re­main un­avail­able in parts of the world for some time due to the chal­lenges of man­u­fac­tur­ing and dis­tribut­ing it on a large scale.</p>
    <p>“So, don’t think of vac­cines as a sil­ver bul­let,” Mr Thar­man said at the open­ing ses­sion of this year’s Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit. “It re­quires a whole set of tools – quick and cheap testing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, peo­ple wear­ing a mask be­cause it is the re­spon­si­ble thing to do, and the so­cial pro­to­cols that have to be­come the norm in ev­ery civilised so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, Covid-19 will hope­fully have brought about a greater recog­ni­tion of the plight of the vul­ner­a­ble across so­ci­eties, he added. “There will be greater recog­ni­tion and a greater de­sire to up­lift the lives of those who are dis­ad­van­taged.”</p>
    <p>The an­nual Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit, which ex­am­ines global trends, went online this year due to Covid-19. Top­ics that will be dis­cussed from to­day to Thurs­day evening in­clude how the coro­n­avirus has im­pacted global trade and the sus­tain­abil­ity agenda.</p>
    <p>In his di­a­logue mod­er­ated by con­fer­ence chair­man Ho Kwon Ping, Mr Thar­man noted that the low­est­paid and most vul­ner­a­ble seg­ments of ev­ery so­ci­ety have been worst hit by the pan­demic. Women, in par­tic­u­lar, have been dis­ad­van­taged be­cause they are dis­pro­por­tion­ately rep­re­sented in the re­tail and food and bev­er­age sec­tors, he said.</p>
    <p>“And there is a risk that that rise in fe­male labour force par­tic­i­pa­tion that we saw over many years will now go through some re­ver­sal, par­tic­u­larly among those at the lower end of the in­come lad­der,” he said.</p>
    <p>On the global stage, the pan­demic poses a risk to the de­vel­op­ing world, he added. Over the last 30 years, a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of de­vel­op­ing so­ci­eties have started mov­ing up the lad­der and catch­ing up.</p>
    <p>But now, cap­i­tal flows are go­ing to be very dis­crim­i­nat­ing, he said, mean­ing that the coun­tries worst hit in terms of pub­lic health and be­ing able to manage this crisis will find them­selves at an even greater dis­ad­van­tage. “So, we re­ally may be get­ting a per­fect storm, where the emerg­ing world be­comes sub­merg­ing, out­side of China.”</p>
    <p>These coun­tries are likely to be worst hit in terms of the eco­nomic fall­out of Covid-19, their abil­ity to re-equip their health­care sys­tems, and in ed­u­ca­tion, where the pan­demic has been a “huge set­back for a gen­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>In these coun­tries, young peo­ple may en­ter the work­force only to find lit­tle op­por­tu­nity – a recipe for in­sta­bil­ity both within these so­ci­eties, as well as the rest of the world, he said.</p>
    <p>And even when a suc­cess­ful vac­cine is de­vel­oped, these in­equal­i­ties will re­main. “Man­u­fac­tur­ing at scale and dis­tribut­ing at scale through the very cold chains re­quired, mi­nus 20 to mi­nus 80 deg C, is go­ing to be a huge chal­lenge,” Mr Thar­man said. “So, a large part of the world is not go­ing to have ac­cess to that for quite a while.”</p>
