    <p>NEW YORK • Michelle Wie West’s eyes were not hol­lowed by ex­haus­tion, as one might have ex­pected of a first-time mother of a one-month-old. Her face was not streaked with tears, as it was 13 months ago af­ter her in­jury-plagued body failed her yet again, lend­ing a hint of fi­nal­ity to a golf ca­reer that had once seemed lim­it­less.</p>
    <p>Last week, Wie West, 30, looked and sounded re­freshed dur­ing a vir­tual news con­fer­ence to an­nounce her ap­point­ment as as­sis­tant cap­tain for next year’s Sol­heim Cup.</p>
    <p>She talked about moth­er­hood and hinted at a pos­si­ble re­turn to com­pe­ti­tion and laughed off any men­tion of her rested ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>“It’s con­cealer and cof­fee, the two C’s,” she said with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Over her right shoul­der hung one of sev­eral self-por­traits she had painted over the years, this one of a woman in black-and-white with her hair piled high atop her head, set against a pas­tel, sponged back­ground.</p>
    <p>The un­framed paint­ing, one of a few dec­o­rat­ing the walls of her San Fran­cisco home, ex­udes a seren­ity that was ab­sent in her ear­lier por­traits, like the one from her teens of a woman with long black hair, sad eyes and a boarded-up mouth.</p>
    <p>Wie West has been in the public eye since 2000, when, at 10, she be­came the youngest player to qual­ify for the US Women’s Am­a­teur Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Over the past two decades she has won five LPGA ti­tles, in­clud­ing the 2014 US Women’s Open, earned an un­der­grad­u­ate de­gree in com­mu­ni­ca­tions from Stan­ford and nearly made the cut in a PGA Tour event.</p>
    <p>Along the way she be­came a sort of a psy­cho­log­i­cal test for par­ents who saw her story as a child­hood lost in the pur­suit of riches or one saved by an em­pha­sis on ed­u­ca­tion; a child’s pas­sion nur­tured by lov­ing par­ents or one un­der­mined by their ac­tive in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>Wie West said she has not thought in­tently about how she will raise her daugh­ter, Makenna Ka­malei Yoona West, though she is sure of this: She hopes to give her the sib­lings that she, an only child, grew up yearn­ing for, and the flu­ency in Korean that she is so glad her South Korea-born par­ents in­sisted upon.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber I used to hate my par­ents for mak­ing me go to Korean school on Satur­days,” she said as her daugh­ter made coo­ing noises while nap­ping in her lap. “But that is some­thing that I’ll def­i­nitely be do­ing, be­ing able to speak Korean is very im­por­tant to me.”</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter al­ready has a cus­tom-made wedge and put­ter. Wie West’s hus­band, Jon­nie, an ex­ec­u­tive with the Golden State War­riors, played bas­ket­ball through col­lege, at West Vir­ginia.</p>
    <p>“My hus­band is such a golf nerd, I’m sure he’s go­ing to try to put a golf club in her hands as soon as pos­si­ble,” she said. “We’ll see whether she grabs a bas­ket­ball or golf club.”</p>
    <p>Her last com­pet­i­tive round of golf was in June last year, at the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship at Hazel­tine, out­side Min­neapo­lis.</p>
    <p>She shot con­sec­u­tive rounds in the 80s to miss the cut. Her sur­gi­cally re­paired right hand was not get­ting bet­ter, she said then, and there had been many in­juries to her neck, back, hip, knee and an­kle.</p>
    <p>She mar­ried West two months later.</p>
    <p>She has re­sumed prac­tis­ing, cart­ing her daugh­ter to the range with her be­tween feed­ings. A re­turn to com­pet­i­tive golf be­fore the end of the cal­en­dar year is not out of the ques­tion, she said, but only if the spread of the coronaviru­s is under con­trol.</p>
    <p>“It just re­ally de­pends on the state of the world right now be­cause her health comes first,” she said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">With her daugh&#xAD;ter in tow, Michelle Wie&#xD;&#xA;West could still make a come&#xAD;back to play com&#xAD;pet&#xAD;i&#xAD;tive golf this year, if the coronaviru&#xAD;s is con&#xAD;trolled.
