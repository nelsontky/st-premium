    <p>Singer-song­writer Shazuan Shi­raj, who goes by the stage name Abangsapau, lost his fa­ther sud­denly in May while Sin­ga­pore was in the grip of the cir­cuit breaker dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As al­ways, to cope with tough times, the 21-year-old turned to what he knew best – writ­ing mu­sic.</p>
    <p>At the be­gin­ning of the cir­cuit breaker he had al­ready writ­ten a song ti­tled Each Other, and come Aug 9 at the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) evening show, he will be singing it with his mother, Madam Farhana Ibrahim, 50.</p>
    <p>He said: “I’m just re­ally grate­ful to be per­form­ing a song that was truly from my heart and the fact that the NDP (or­gan­is­ers) be­lieve in me and my mes­sage enough to give me such a plat­form means a lot to me.”</p>
    <p>Ded­i­cated to Mr Shazuan’s late fa­ther, the track is meant for any­one who has ex­pe­ri­enced loss dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The singer-song­writer, who is per­form­ing at the NDP for the first time, has also helped his mother ful­fil a life­long dream.</p>
    <p>He said: “I went to the stu­dio the day be­fore the cir­cuit breaker was im­ple­mented to record this and I felt like I wanted fe­male vo­cals on it. So I was think­ing who I could ap­proach for it, and I re­alised I had some­one right at home. My mother al­ways wanted to be a singer and to be able to bring her on board has been mag­i­cal.”</p>
    <p>Or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans over­com­ing the odds will be a re­cur­ring theme at this year’s NDP. The show, which has been re­vamped since the emer­gence of Covid-19, will fea­ture a mix of lo­cal tal­ents, front-line work­ers and com­mu­nity heroes.</p>
    <p>All the per­form­ers un­der­went a swab test for Covid-19 this month and will have a sec­ond one in the days lead­ing up to the show.</p>
    <p>They have also had their tem­per­a­tures taken twice daily and have to use the TraceTo­gether mo­bile app and SafeEn­try.</p>
    <p>The chore­og­ra­phy has been tai­lored to al­low for safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween par­tic­i­pants, with the to­tal num­ber of peo­ple on stage at a time not ex­ceed­ing 50 at any point.</p>
    <p>Masks are worn, ex­cept when the dance rou­tines are stren­u­ous or the par­tic­i­pants are singing, and mi­cro­phones are in­di­vid­u­ally as­signed and dis­in­fected after each use.</p>
    <p>Off stage, par­tic­i­pants have been split into groups of five for breaks and stag­gered meal times.</p>
    <p>They are not al­lowed to min­gle be­tween groups.</p>
    <p>For view­ers at home, a dig­i­tal NDP Show guide will be re­leased. It will pro­vide a syn­op­sis of the show to ex­plain high­lights us­ing text and pic­tures, as well as song lyrics.</p>
    <p>View­ers can ex­pect an NDP un­like any other as the en­tire show has been con­cep­tu­alised to be viewed on screen.</p>
    <p>Six sec­tions make up the evening show, mostly de­voted to show­cas­ing how Sin­ga­pore­ans have dealt with the ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual choir, a mix of many sub­mis­sions from Sin­ga­pore­ans singing We Are Sin­ga­pore, will be un­veiled.</p>
    <p>Those at home can sing along, with per­for­mances of clas­sic NDP songs also be­ing broad­cast dur­ing the show.</p>
    <p>The pledge will be re­cited in uni­son at 8.20pm.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this, house­holds are en­cour­aged to use the red torch stick­ers in­side the Sin­ga­pore To­gether Pack on their phone torch­light to show ap­pre­ci­a­tion to the front-line fight­ers, es­sen­tial ser­vice work­ers and com­mu­nity heroes.</p>
    <p>The show will con­clude with fire­works across the is­land.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing his thoughts on the NDP evening show, cre­ative di­rec­tor Roys­ton Tan said: “We had hoped to cap­ture the very real and re­lat­able ex­pe­ri­ences of Sin­ga­pore­ans this year. 2020 has not been rosy, but amidst the strug­gle, there have been in­cred­i­ble acts of kind­ness, re­silience and unity, which we want to share with the rest of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
