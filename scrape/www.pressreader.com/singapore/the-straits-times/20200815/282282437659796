    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • A play-in tour­na­ment will be held for the first time to­day to de­cide the eighth and fi­nal National Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-off seed in the Western Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into Thurs­day, four teams were in con­tention as fewer than four games sep­a­rated them.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite beat­ing the Dal­las Mav­er­icks 128-102 to be­come the only team to go 8-0 in the “bub­ble”, the Phoenix Suns were ul­ti­mately elim­i­nated (34-39) be­cause of their pre-bub­ble form.</p>
    <p>So, too, were the San An­to­nio Spurs (32-39), whose NBA jointbest record of 22 suc­ces­sive post­sea­son trips came to an end after a 118-112 de­feat by the Utah Jazz.</p>
    <p>As such, the eighth-seeded Port­land Trail Blaz­ers (35-39) will host the Mem­phis Griz­zlies (34-39), in ninth, at Dis­ney World, need­ing just one win to seal a play-off berth.</p>
    <p>If the Blaz­ers lose, the teams will play again to­mor­row, with the vic­tor claim­ing the fi­nal post-sea­son spot and a meet­ing with the topseeded Los An­ge­les Lak­ers in the first round next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Port­land en­dured a nerve-wrack­ing game, trail­ing the Brook­lyn Nets by four points over 90 seconds into the fourth quar­ter be­fore Damian Lil­lard took over the show.</p>
    <p>The five-time All-Star is known as “Dame Time” for his abil­ity to come up clutch in the dy­ing mo­ments of NBA games.</p>
    <p>Ever since he was mocked by Los An­ge­les Clip­pers duo Paul Ge­orge and Pa­trick Bev­er­ley for miss­ing a pair of late free throws, lead­ing to a loss last Satur­day, he has been on fire. Thurs­day was no dif­fer­ent as the guard led all scorers with 42 points to push the Blaz­ers over the line with a 134-133 win, en­sur­ing they have a shot of qual­i­fy­ing for the post-sea­son for the sev­enth straight sea­son.</p>
    <p>His 154-point to­tal in the past three games are the most any player has scored in their fi­nal three games of a sea­son. He is also the first player in NBA his­tory to end the reg­u­lar sea­son with three suc­ces­sive 40-plus point games.</p>
    <p>Twelve of his 42 points against the Nets came in the fi­nal 12 min­utes, but Lil­lard claimed he was sim­ply liv­ing up to his moniker – as he has done over the last eight cam­paigns with Port­land.</p>
    <p>“I just didn’t want to be too pas­sive,” he told ESPN. “So, as I was bring­ing the ball up, I said, ‘As soon as I see an op­por­tu­nity, I’m gonna raise up.’ I’ll al­ways be ready men­tally. I’m never con­cerned about that (go­ing down to the wire).”</p>
    <p>Blaz­ers coach Terry Stotts could only doff his cap to his star player, but he knows that they have yet to reach the promised land.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, the roll that he’s been on... that’s Dame,we needed ev­ery one of (those points),” he said. “We’re ex­cited to be in the play-in round, but it’s not like we were jump­ing up and down... We’ve got a tough op­po­nent in Mem­phis.”</p>
    <p>Un­like the Blaz­ers, the Griz­zlies had it eas­ier in their 119-106 vic­tory over the NBA top seeds, the Mil­wau­kee Bucks, who were miss­ing Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo who was sus­pended.</p>
    <p>With just two wins since en­ter­ing the “bub­ble”, Mem­phis have only just man­aged to squeak into the play-off con­ver­sa­tion, so crit­ics have in­stalled the Blaz­ers as the favourites to go through.</p>
    <p>Their star cen­tre Jaren Jack­son Jr has also been ruled out with a sea­son-end­ing knee in­jury, but Rookie of the Year front run­ner Ja Mo­rant, who contribute­d 12 points against the Bucks, be­lieves that even if they fail to earn a post-sea­son berth for the first time since 2017, his team are still over­achiev­ers.</p>
    <p>“We were pro­jected to be, what, 27th? Now look at us. Be­ing that un­der­dog doesn’t mat­ter to us at all,” he told ESPN. “We love be­ing the un­der­dog. It’s just ex­tra mo­ti­va­tion, fuel to the fire.”</p>
    <p>I just didn’t want to be too pas­sive... I’ll al­ways be ready men­tally. I’m never con­cerned about that (go­ing down to the wire).</p>
