    <p>Hav­ing trained non-le­gal per­son­nel ac­com­pany for­eign work­ers to po­lice in­ter­views would put fur­ther strain on an al­ready stretched po­lice force, said Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>This could de­lay in­ter­views and re­sult in is­sues such as miss­ing ev­i­dence, he added in his min­is­te­rial state­ment yes­ter­day on the case in­volv­ing for­mer maid Parti Liyani.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam was re­spond­ing to Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC), who had asked if a scheme sim­i­lar to the Ap­pro­pri­ate Adult scheme for mi­nors and men­tally vul­ner­a­ble per­sons could be im­ple­mented for for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers and other work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Last year, Ap­pro­pri­ate Adults were ac­ti­vated 2,300 times, the min­is­ter said. From 2015 to last year, an av­er­age of 2,741 for­eign work­ers on work per­mits were ar­rested each year as sus­pects.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­teer pool would have to at least dou­ble for Ap­pro­pri­ate Adults to at­tend to ev­ery for­eign worker in­ter­view, he said.</p>
    <p>These vol­un­teers would have to be trained and pro­vided with the rel­e­vant re­sources, he added. On top of that, some in­di­vid­u­als might have to give mul­ti­ple state­ments.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing an Ap­pro­pri­ate Adult for ev­ery for­eign worker in­ter­viewed would thus be­come “a real con­straint and load on the po­lice”.</p>
    <p>These for­eign work­ers are adults, Mr Shan­mugam added. “The key is for the po­lice to make sure that the for­eign work­ers un­der­stand the ques­tions and that their an­swers are prop­erly recorded.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said about 1,100 in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cers han­dled 66,200 crim­i­nal cases in 2016.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the ra­tio of po­lice of­fi­cers – in­clud­ing full-time na­tional ser­vice­men – to the broader pop­u­la­tion is 0.23 per cent, he added. In con­trast, New York has a ra­tio of 0.42 per cent, while Lon­don clocks in at 0.34 per cent and Hong Kong, 0.39 per cent.</p>
    <p>“My con­cern is that there is a limit to how much our of­fi­cers can do with in­creas­ing work­load and in­creas­ing ex­pec­ta­tions, but with­out a pro­por­tion­ate in­crease in man­power,” he said.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, he had cited the po­lice force’s man­power crunch as one rea­son for the lapses in in­ves­ti­gat­ing Ms Parti’s case.</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh then asked how sig­nif­i­cant this is­sue was: “Can it be a mat­ter that can be re­solved by di­rec­tives or cir­cu­lars from the com­mand­ing of­fi­cers of var­i­ous di­vi­sions?”</p>
    <p>“The man­power is­sue can­not be an ex­cuse,” Mr Shan­mugam replied, re­it­er­at­ing that the in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer had bro­ken the rules. “Let’s be clear about that.”</p>
    <p>He added that he would find out what hap­pened in that case, and share his find­ings with Mr Singh, if the rules al­low for it. He also pledged to get a bet­ter sense of the ex­tent of the pres­sure that the po­lice are un­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also asked about a state­ment is­sued by Ms Parti through mi­grant worker rights group</p>
    <p>Home, in which the for­mer maid said she filed a com­plaint against sev­eral of­fi­cers from Tan­glin Po­lice Divi­sion on July 3.</p>
    <p>She high­lighted that her state­ment was taken in Malay rather than Ba­hasa In­done­sia, her be­lief that there was pos­si­ble tam­per­ing with ev­i­dence in or­der to cast her as be­ing un­truth­ful in court, as well as the de­lays in se­cur­ing ev­i­dence for the case.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said he had not ex­am­ined the Home state­ment care­fully. “If there is a spe­cific con­cern about what has been set out in the Home state­ment... a ques­tion can be put up and we can deal with it,” the min­is­ter added.</p>
    <p>He noted that he had al­ready ad­dressed sev­eral is­sues raised by Ms Parti in his min­is­te­rial state­ment, in­clud­ing those of in­ter­pre­ta­tion and the fact that the in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer viewed the crime scene only five weeks after Ms Parti’s for­mer em­ploy­ers made a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>“I think, Mr Singh, that we all know that Ms Liyani is not do­ing this,” Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>“We know why this is be­ing done. But po­lice will deal with it, and will re­spond in due course. And I’m not sug­gest­ing that any­body in this House is re­spon­si­ble for it.”</p>
