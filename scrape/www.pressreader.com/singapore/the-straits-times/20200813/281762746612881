    <p>SLOW RE­SPONSE TO SEC­OND WAVE</p>
    <p>We had a very rapid im­prove­ment with the first lock­down, largely be­cause we didn’t have much com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion... We were set up to think it was eas­ier than it should be, which, on the sec­ond time, made us re­act slower than we should have.’’</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CI­ATE PRO­FES­SOR BEN PHILLIPS, an ecol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Mel­bourne, who says the suc­cess of Aus­tralia’s first lock­down in March and April may have prompted Vic­to­ria to re­spond too slowly to its sec­ond out­break in late June.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s state of Vic­to­ria recorded its worst day of Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties yes­ter­day, but ex­perts be­lieve the cur­rent lock­down is bring­ing the out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Ten days af­ter Vic­to­ria’s govern­ment im­posed a strict lock­down on Mel­bourne, the coun­try’s sec­ond­largest city, the au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day said 410 new cases had been con­firmed in the state and a fur­ther 21 deaths. The cur­rent six-week lock­down be­gan on Aug 2 and in­cludes a cur­few from 8pm to 5am and the clo­sure of schools and all non-es­sen­tial shops. This was ex­pected to lead to re­duced case num­bers by the mid­dle of this week.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s Premier Daniel An­drews said the cur­rent lock­down was work­ing, de­spite case num­bers in­creas­ing from 331 on Tues­day. There were 322 new cases on Mon­day and 394 on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“If you look at the av­er­age over the last seven days, we are see­ing the line come down,” he told re­porters. “It’s not ex­act be­cause it’s all depend­ing on lit­er­ally hun­dreds of mil­lions of in­di­vid­ual choices and de­ci­sions that each of us makes ev­ery sin­gle day.”</p>
    <p>The re­cent strict lock­down was im­posed af­ter pre­vi­ous mea­sures ap­peared to be fail­ing to re­duce case num­bers. The au­thor­i­ties said sick peo­ple con­tin­ued to go to work – par­tic­u­larly ca­sual work­ers who were not en­ti­tled to sick leave – and peo­ple were flout­ing re­quire­ments to stay at home.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ben Phillips, an ecol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Mel­bourne, said he be­lieved case num­bers were likely to drop fast over the com­ing days. He said the in­crease yes­ter­day may be due to vari­a­tions in daily num­bers caused by fac­tors such as the tim­ing of pro­cess­ing test sam­ples. In ad­di­tion, he said, Covid-19 case num­bers tend to de­cline much more slowly af­ter lock­downs than they go up dur­ing out­breaks.</p>
    <p>“Case num­bers in Vic­to­ria are drop­ping and should con­tinue to drop quite fast,” he told The Straits Times. “The pre­vi­ous lock­down was hav­ing an ef­fect, but it was slower than ev­ery­one would have liked. It is much harder for the virus to propagate now.”</p>
    <p>He added that the in­crease in num­ber of deaths in re­cent days was oc­cur­ring be­cause fa­tal­ity num­bers lag be­hind new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“On av­er­age, it takes 17 days be­tween pre­sent­ing an ill­ness and get­ting sick enough to die. We will con­tinue to see an un­set­tling num­ber of deaths in the near fu­ture, but it should then con­tinue to drop off.”</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia had recorded 22,127 Covid-19 cases and 353 deaths. Out­side Vic­to­ria, New South Wales, the most pop­u­lous state, recorded 18 new cases yes­ter­day. No other state or ter­ri­tory had any new cases.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data re­leased by Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day showed that the state has had 15,251 cases of Covid-19, in­clud­ing 7,880 ac­tive cases. In to­tal, 3,610 of the cases have in­volved 20to 29-year-olds, who have been the worst-hit age group.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts be­lieve the higher rates of in­fec­tion among younger peo­ple are due to their height­ened risk of ex­po­sure. Younger peo­ple are more likely to gather in larger groups, at­tend work­places or be in­volved in parental ac­tiv­i­ties and shared child-mind­ing that ex­pose them to other fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s govern­ment in­di­cated yes­ter­day that it may con­tinue to re­quire peo­ple to stay at home for sev­eral weeks even af­ter the cur­rent mea­sures end on Sept 13.</p>
    <p>“I would love to be able to con­firm for you what we’re go­ing to be fac­ing in Oc­to­ber,” Mr An­drews said. “We can’t know that.”</p>
    <p>Prof Phillips said the suc­cess of Aus­tralia’s first lock­down in March and April may have prompted Vic­to­ria to re­spond too slowly to its sec­ond out­break in late June.</p>
    <p>“We had a very rapid im­prove­ment with the first lock­down, largely be­cause we didn’t have much com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion,” he said. “We were set up to think it was eas­ier than it should be, which, on the sec­ond time, made us re­act slower than we should have.”</p>
