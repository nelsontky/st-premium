    <p>This for­est-like area is one of six grow rooms in a new ur­ban farm called Com­mon­wealth Greens. Leafy greens such as let­tuce, kale, chard and sor­rel are grown hy­dro­pon­i­cally along each 2.4m white pil­lar. Once the greens have ma­tured, each pil­lar is moved to the pro­cess­ing room for har­vest­ing. Mr Dick­son Ng, 30, agri-tech com­pany Archisen’s farm man­ager, demon­strates how each pil­lar is re­moved from the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>An ur­ban farm that aims to pro­duce high-yield greens with­out sac­ri­fic­ing any flavour by lever­ag­ing In­ter­net of Things tech­nol­ogy was of­fi­cially launched yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Com­mon­wealth Greens took root in Jurong in May. The for­est-like farm con­sists of over 6,200 pil­lars, each of them 2.4m tall, that are rem­i­nis­cent of the fo­liage of trees.</p>
    <p>Po­si­tioned in six dif­fer­ent rooms the size of Hous­ing Board flats, the pil­lars in each room sup­port one type of leafy green: let­tuce, kale, chard or herbs. Hy­dro­pon­ics is used to grow the plants.</p>
    <p>The farm can grow up to 100 tonnes of veg­eta­bles a year, which is close to 1 per cent of leafy veg­eta­bles grown lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the launch yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu vis­ited the farm as well as Archisen, the agri-tech firm that set up and man­ages Com­mon­wealth Greens.</p>
    <p>Archisen’s co-founder and chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer Sven Yeo said Com­mon­wealth Greens is one of the high­est-yield­ing in­door farms</p>
    <p>in Sin­ga­pore and that it will sup­port and con­trib­ute to the coun­try’s goal to self-pro­duce 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs by 2030.</p>
    <p>The farm’s leafy greens are cur­rently sold on on­line su­per­mar­kets such as RedMart and Pan­daMart, un­der the brand Just Pro­duce. Each 100g salad mix that costs be­tween $4 and $4.50 com­prises a va­ri­ety of let­tuce and kale, along with either mustard greens, sor­rel or mizuna.</p>
    <p>From the mid­dle of next month, the farm will start sell­ing spe­cial­ity herbs – mustard greens, ice plant and sor­rel – in 20g boxes which will cost be­tween $4 and $5.</p>
    <p>Archisen has also de­vel­oped a mini ver­sion of its farm­ing sys­tem. Shorter pil­lars brim­ming with full-grown veg­gies are stored in a glass cab­i­net and can be sent to restau­rants for di­rect har­vest­ing. From next month, the com­pany will de­ploy those cab­i­nets to five ho­tels, restau­rants and food ser­vice com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>It is not just its aes­thetic that makes Com­mon­wealth Greens unique.</p>
    <p>To en­sure op­ti­mal yield, fast growth and highly nu­tri­tious and flavour­ful greens, the ver­ti­cal sys­tems are pow­ered by a smart cock­pit that heav­ily lever­ages In­ter­net of Things tech­nol­ogy, data an­a­lyt­ics and sen­sors.</p>
    <p>Data is con­tin­u­ally stored in the cloud, in real time, for the sci­en­tists to an­a­lyse and to drive au­to­ma­tion. For ex­am­ple, if the pH of the nu­tri­ent for let­tuce reaches un­healthy lev­els, sen­sors will alert a de­vice to au­to­mat­i­cally re­store the acid­ity level.</p>
    <p>“As we have more growth cy­cles over time, our data sets in­crease, and that en­ables us to con­struct math­e­mat­i­cal mod­els to pre­dict the out­come of how we grow,” said Mr Yeo.</p>
    <p>Archisen’s of­fice, which is one level above Com­mon­wealth Greens, also houses a re­search lab for con­duct­ing ex­per­i­ments and test­ing new so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>In the near fu­ture, the com­pany plans to build in­door fruit or­chards or vine­yards.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists in the lab are now grow­ing black, red and green grapes in a con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment. In 10 months, the vines have started to bear clus­ters of grapes, each fruit about the size of a chick­pea. Through tra­di­tional farm­ing, it takes about three years to fully grow grapes.</p>
    <p>Although im­ma­ture and smaller grapes tend to be sour, the black grapes from the lab taste sweet.</p>
