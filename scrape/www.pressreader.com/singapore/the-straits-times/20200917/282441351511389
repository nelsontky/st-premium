    <p>Tech­nol­ogy-savvy and highly en­gaged on so­cial me­dia, Asian Amer­i­cans may be one of the most in­flu­en­tial de­mo­graph­ics when it comes to shap­ing en­ter­tain­ment trends in the United States and, by ex­ten­sion, the world.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to data col­lected by Nielsen, the global me­dia and con­sumer an­a­lyt­ics firm. And its vice-pres­i­dent of strate­gic com­mu­nity al­liances, Ms Mariko Car­pen­ter, broke down some of its more in­ter­est­ing find­ings in a re­cent chat with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Asian Amer­i­cans made up just 5.6 per cent of the US pop­u­la­tion in the coun­try’s last cen­sus in 2010, but they now ex­ert an out­sized in­flu­ence on its film, tele­vi­sion and news pro­gram­ming, as well as be­ing in­te­gral to the fast-grow­ing e-sports or video gam­ing in­dus­try world­wide.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­pen­ter at­tributes this to the fact that com­pared with the gen­eral Amer­i­can pop­u­la­tion, the com­mu­nity – the fastest-grow­ing racial or eth­nic group in the US – spends sig­nif­i­cantly more time on dig­i­tal de­vices such as smart­phones and gam­ing de­vices than it does watch­ing live tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>And be­cause its view­ing pat­terns tend to favour ti­tles with eth­ni­cally di­verse casts and Asian-led stories, Hol­ly­wood has been spurred to pro­duce more cul­tur­ally var­ied con­tent, she be­lieves.</p>
    <p>Nielsen found that Asian Amer­i­cans – about a quar­ter of whom were of Chi­nese origin as of 2015, fol­lowed by In­di­ans (20 per cent) and Filipinos (19 per cent) – are more likely to be early adopters of new tech­nol­ogy and me­dia plat­forms com­pared with the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This dig­i­tal savvy springs from the fact that “the in­flu­ence on them from Asia is huge”, says the ex­ec­u­tive, who co-au­thors the re­ports that Nielsen pub­lishes on AsianAmer­i­can con­sumers, which it shares with me­dia and re­tail clients as well as man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>“If you t hink about all the im­mi­grants com­ing to this coun­try, they left a world with apps such as WeChat, where you are buy­ing a pair of jeans on­line or look­ing up an ar­ti­cle or trans­fer­ring money or shop­ping at one of the big e-com­merce stores in China.</p>
    <p>“So they come here be­ing al­ready very ad­vanced when it comes to tech­nol­ogy,” says the New York­based Ja­panese Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>Asian im­mi­grants also use tech­nol­ogy to stay in touch with their home coun­tries and cul­tures, she adds – “to con­nect to con­tent that’s not read­ily avail­able here or to fam­ily abroad be­cause we are bi­cul­tural”.</p>
    <p>As gamers, spec­ta­tors and con­tent cre­ators, Asian Amer­i­cans are also over-rep­re­sented in an en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try that has seen ex­po­nen­tial growth since the coro­n­avirus lock­downs: e-sports and video gam­ing, which have strong ties to China, home of the world’s largest game com­pany Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Nielsen noted that Asian Amer­i­cans are 14 per cent more likely to own a gam­ing con­sole and 37 per cent more likely to own vir­tual-re­al­ity head­sets that are mainly used for gam­ing.</p>
    <p>And two of the 10 high­est-paid gamers in the world – Mark Ed­ward Fis­chbach and Evan Fong – are Asian Amer­i­can, as is an­other pop­u­lar fig­ure, Jeremy Wang.</p>
    <p>But per­haps the most sub­tle way the Asian-Amer­i­can com­mu­nity is in­flu­enc­ing pop­u­lar culture is through its sup­port for more eth­ni­cally di­verse con­tent in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>This can be seen in the pop­u­lar­ity of films and shows with Asian stars – ro­man­tic com­edy hits such as Crazy Rich Asians (2018) and the To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before se­ries (2018 to present) as well as the TV show Fresh Off The Boat (2015 to 2020), not to men­tion the grow­ing list of Asian-Amer­i­can co­me­di­ans find­ing success, in­clud­ing Ali Wong, Jimmy O. Yang and Jo Koy.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that in 2007, the per­cent­age of Asian-speak­ing char­ac­ters in US films was 3.4 per cent. By 2018, that num­ber had grown to 8.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>And be­cause Asian Amer­i­cans en­gage on so­cial me­dia more than the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion and are not shy about tout­ing their favourite shows, they are often in­stru­men­tal to these ti­tles and names tak­ing off.</p>
    <p>“It’s that so­cial en­gage­ment that re­ally helps with the al­go­rithms for a lot of the con­tent,” Ms Car­pen­ter ob­serves.</p>
    <p>“It cre­ates a mo­men­tum for cer­tain things to get pop­u­lar and be dis­cov­ered by a big­ger au­di­ence.”</p>
    <p>This has not gone un­no­ticed in Tin­sel­town.</p>
    <p>“The stream­ing plat­forms are the ones paving the way in terms of di­verse con­tent, but all the tra­di­tional TV net­works are also see­ing and un­der­stand­ing the de­mand for it and think­ing of that as they cast new shows much more in­clu­sively than in the past,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Stream­ers such as Net­flix are also glob­ally pro­mot­ing con­tent made in Asia, such as the re­al­ity se­ries Ter­race House (2012 to present) and In­dian Match­mak­ing (2020), and Asian-Amer­i­can view­ers have helped these be­come hits in the US.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­pen­ter, a Ter­race House fan, says: “I log on to Net­flix just to watch that and I’ve then be­come a fan of other Net­flix shows.”</p>
    <p>In pub­lish­ing this data, Nielsen hopes that US con­tent cre­ators and mar­keters will fi­nally give Asian con­sumers – a pre­vi­ously ne­glected seg­ment of the mar­ket – the at­ten­tion they de­serve.</p>
    <p>“We want to pro­mote an un­der­stand­ing of our com­mu­nity and the con­tri­bu­tions we make not just to the econ­omy and so­ci­ety, but the cul­tural land­scape as well.”</p>
