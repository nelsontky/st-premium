    <p>The Den­ver Nuggets ripped up the made-in-Hol­ly­wood script, stun­ning the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers 104-89 in Game 7 to reach their first Western Con­fer­ence fi­nals in 11 years.</p>
    <p>Den­ver will once again be the un­der­dogs when they face LeBron James and the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers in the con­fer­ence fi­nals be­gin­ning to­mor­row. But Ja­mal Mur­ray is­sued a warn­ing – on and off the court – for those who think the Lak­ers’ jug­ger­naut is go­ing to steam­roll them.</p>
    <p>The guard scored a game-high 40 points at Walt Dis­ney World and Nikola Jo­kic had a triple-dou­ble as third-seeded Den­ver be­came the first team in Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) his­tory to rally from a 3-1 se­ries deficit twice in the same post-sea­son.</p>
    <p>They are also the only team in play-off his­tory with three straight dou­ble-digit come­back wins when fac­ing elim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In Game 5, they over­came a 16-point deficit. In Game 6, they over­turned a 19-point hole. And on Tues­day, they fought back after be</p>
    <p>ing down by 12 in the first half.</p>
    <p>“I think this is our sixth straight elim­i­na­tion game,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “Seventy-one days in the bub­ble and just to stay to­gether, that com­mit­ment, that tough­ness is – you don’t see that around very often.”</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the Clip­pers once again failed to reach the con­fer­ence fi­nals. They fell to 0-8 all-time in games where they could have made that break­through. They also led 3-1 against the Houston Rock­ets in the sec­ond round in 2015.</p>
    <p>This time, they had the reign­ing Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard and his su­per­star side­kick Paul Ge­orge; a deep bench head­lined by Sixth Man of the Year Mon­trezl Har­rell; a cham­pi­onship coach; and a re­vi­talised fran­chise bankrolled by the NBA’s rich­est owner Steve Ballmer.</p>
    <p>They were sup­posed to be ti­tle con­tenders chal­leng­ing the bal­ance of power in Hol­ly­wood. In­stead the Clip­pers col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>Leonard and Ge­orge com­bined to score five points on two-of-18 shoot­ing in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Nine-year vet­eran Leonard recorded the worst field goal per­cent­age in any half of his ca­reer in which he had at least 10 at­tempts, mak­ing one of 11 shots.</p>
    <p>He man­aged j ust 14 points, Pa­trick Bev­er­ley scored 11 and Ge­orge fin­ished with 10, while Har­rell had 20 points for the sec­ond­seeded Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>“I am the coach and I’ll take any blame for it,” coach Doc Rivers said. “But we didn’t meet our ex­pec­ta­tions, clearly. Hon­estly, you could just see the dif­fer­ence in the two teams. That team has been to­gether. We haven’t.”</p>
    <p>Den­ver have the chem­istry that the Clip­pers lacked.</p>
    <p>“We are just im­prov­ing. We have talks, we have fights, every­thing. We are like a cou­ple,” Jo­kic said of play­ing with Mur­ray after the dy­namic duo com­bined for 56 points.</p>
    <p>The Ser­bian big man com­pleted his triple-dou­ble by the third quar­ter and fin­ished with 16 points, 13 as­sists and 22 re­bounds. His re­bound count is the most by a Nuggets player in an NBA play-off game, break­ing his old record of 19.</p>
    <p>The top-seeded Lak­ers have been cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>“They got to worry about us too,” Mur­ray said.</p>
