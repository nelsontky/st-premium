    <p>More peo­ple re­ceived fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance from the Gov­ern­ment in the past year, with about 78,600 in­di­vid­u­als ben­e­fit­ing from the var­i­ous ComCare schemes. The Gov­ern­ment gave out $151 mil­lion in cash as­sis­tance through the ComCare schemes in FY2019, the largest sum dis­bursed in the past five years.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple re­ceived fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance from the Gov­ern­ment in the past year, with about 78,600 in­di­vid­u­als ben­e­fit­ing from the var­i­ous ComCare schemes, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the MSF’s ComCare An­nual Report, there was an in­crease of about 4 per cent in the num­ber of fi­nan­cial aid re­cip­i­ents in its last fi­nan­cial year – which ended on March 31 this year – from the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment gave out $151 mil­lion in cash as­sis­tance through the ComCare schemes in FY2019. This is a 19 per cent jump from the 2018 fi­nan­cial year and is the largest sum dis­bursed in the past five years.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nity Care En­dow­ment Fund (ComCare Fund) is a key so­cial safety net for lower-in­come fam­i­lies and it com­prises schemes such as the Short-To-Medium-Term As­sis­tance (SMTA) and Long-Term As­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said:</p>
    <p>“There has been a broad-based in­crease in the num­ber of peo­ple who re­ceived ComCare sup­port in the last fi­nan­cial year. We have also seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease of 20 to 30 per cent in ComCare ap­pli­ca­tions in re­cent months, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“As so­cial needs grow and eco­nomic out­look re­mains uncer­tain, we will con­tinue to reach out to those in need and fo­cus our re­sources on those with greater needs.”</p>
    <p>The in­crease in ComCare re­cip­i­ents was driven largely by a rise of about 5 per cent in SMTA re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>SMTA pro­vides tem­po­rary fi­nan­cial aid and other forms of help to tide re­cip­i­ents through tough times as they are look­ing for a job or are ill, among other rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The bulk of ComCare re­cip­i­ents, about 64,400 in­di­vid­u­als, were on SMTA in the last fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als on the In­terim As­sis­tance Schemes in­creased by about 16 per cent to about 7,700 in the last fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>The In­terim As­sis­tance Schemes are ad­min­is­tered by so­cial ser­vice of­fices and other com­mu­nity groups – such as fam­ily ser­vice cen­tres – to pro­vide im­me­di­ate fi­nan­cial aid to those who re­quire ur­gent and tem­po­rary fi­nan­cial re­lief.</p>
    <p>About 9,600 chil­dren re­ceived Stu­dent Care Fee As­sis­tance in the last fi­nan­cial year, about 6 per cent higher than the year be­fore, due to more stu­dent care cen­tres be­ing set up in schools, the MSF said.</p>
    <p>The only scheme to buck the ris­ing trend was the Long-Term As­sis­tance scheme, also known as Pub­lic As­sis­tance, which pro­vides a cash sum to the des­ti­tute who can­not work due to old age or ill­ness and have lit­tle or no fam­ily sup­port.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als on Long-Term As­sis­tance fell by around 3 per cent to about 4,400 in the last fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause there were fewer ComCare ap­pli­cants who are per­ma­nently un­able to work and with­out fam­ily sup­port, the MSF spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh Phee Kai, 70, has been on the Long-Term As­sis­tance scheme since 2016. He re­ceives $418 a month. The bach­e­lor ap­plied for fi­nan­cial aid af­ter be­ing re­trenched from his se­cu­rity guard job in 2015.</p>
    <p>He also gets $260 a month from his Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund and uses the money to pay for his ex­penses.</p>
    <p>“The sum I re­ceive now is less than half of what I used to earn when I was work­ing. But I can­not work any more be­cause of my blad­der and bowel in­con­ti­nence, so I have to rely on these pay­outs,” said Mr Koh, who lives alone in a one-room rental flat.</p>
    <p>Ms Joyz Tan, senior so­cial worker at Fei Yue Com­mu­nity Ser­vices, noted that many of the lower-wage work­ers are work­ing part time, tem­po­rar­ily or on an ad hoc ba­sis – and they are the ones more likely to lose their jobs when business is down.</p>
    <p>Many of them also work in the re­tail and food and bev­er­age sec­tors, which were hit hard by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Madam Zaleha Ah­mad, cen­tre di­rec­tor of the Mar­riage Hub at AMP Sin­ga­pore, said many of the fam­i­lies on ComCare usu­ally have just one bread­win­ner, on whose wage a few mem­bers de­pend.</p>
    <p>To tide Sin­ga­pore­ans through the re­ces­sion, the MSF has au­to­mat­i­cally ex­tended by six months the ComCare scheme for ben­e­fi­cia­ries whose aid is due for re­view by this month. New ben­e­fi­cia­ries will also gen­er­ally re­ceive at least six months of as­sis­tance.</p>
