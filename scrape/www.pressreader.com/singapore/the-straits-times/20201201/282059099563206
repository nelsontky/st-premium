    <p>With the move to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion in more ar­eas of life, the pub­lic sec­tor re­port card is no ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>For the first time since it was first pub­lished a decade ago, there will be no hard copies of the Sin­ga­pore Pub­lic Sec­tor Out­comes Re­view (Spor), a bi­en­nial stock­take of the sec­tor’s work.</p>
    <p>This year’s re­port, re­leased last Thurs­day and co­or­di­nated by the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF), has gone fully dig­i­tal. It shows in­comes in Sin­ga­pore have risen and in­equal­ity has fallen in the past five years, among other in­di­ca­tors of progress.</p>
    <p>A seven-strong team at MOF tried to keep things sim­ple by plac­ing the in­for­ma­tion un­der two broad cat­e­gories – cit­i­zens and busi­nesses. They worked with 15 other min­istries and their statu­tory boards to de­velop the write-ups on the Spor web­site.</p>
    <p>“If you are an in­ter­ested ci­ti­zen, you can jump around (the web­site), look at things you’re in­ter­ested in, and skip the rest or come back later to look at other things,” said Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Fi­nance Tan Ching Yee.</p>
    <p>There is a stronger fo­cus on out­comes in the re­port, she added. “In­stead of say­ing we had rolled out this new scheme, or cut down a cer­tain num­ber of steps, we took a more de­lib­er­ate ef­fort to em­pha­sise the ‘so what?’ as­pect – such as the fact that one can start a busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore within 11/ days.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>The changes re­flect the pub­lic ser­vice’s dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, which has sped up due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It is hard to imag­ine the pub­lic ser­vice go­ing back to “life as it was be­fore”, said Ms Tan, 56.</p>
    <p>“Many things that we thought we couldn’t do, like hav­ing vir­tual meet­ings as a norm, be­came the de­fault mode dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>She re­called how, two years ago when there was a Bud­get sur­plus, Sin­ga­pore­ans were given the op­tion of re­ceiv­ing the SG Bonus pay­out via PayNow-NRIC. It al­lowed them to re­ceive the money in their bank ac­counts us­ing their NRIC num­bers with­out hav­ing to dis­close their ac­count de­tails. They were also able to change their ac­counts as and when they wished.</p>
    <p>MOF worked with the banks, Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice (SNDGO), Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore and As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore to en­cour­age sign-ups, and was pleas­antly sur­prised by the 60 per cent jump in sign-ups then.</p>
    <p>But the take-up rate amid Covid-19 surged even fur­ther – num­ber­ing 1.7 mil­lion by Septem­ber, up from 1.1 mil­lion in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps the case for (us­ing it) ear­lier was not so strong, as it was mainly for sur­plus-shar­ing. But when it came to Covid-19, the fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion was more dire,” she said. Also, phys­i­cal move­ments were re­stricted dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she added. More peo­ple be­came aware of the con­ve­nience and safety that on­line trans­ac­tions af­ford.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple re­alised that get­ting the money in the bank was prob­a­bly bet­ter than queue­ing up at a bank branch and bank­ing in a cheque.”</p>
    <p>She noted Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, in his For­ti­tude Bud­get speech in May, had said more help will be given to stu­dents and se­niors to ac­cess dig­i­tal re­sources.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said the out­break has af­firmed that the na­tion’s dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion push is the right way to go, adding: “We want to en­sure that the dig­i­tal jour­ney is not just some­thing that only young peo­ple, or cer­tain peo­ple, can have.”</p>
