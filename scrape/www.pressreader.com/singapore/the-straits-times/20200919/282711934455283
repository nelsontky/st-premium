    <p>Meal plan­ning for a fam­ily, a chal­lenge on its own, can be more so now due to the work-from- home re­quire­ments by which many em­ploy­ees con­tinue to abide. With more fam­ily mem­bers stay­ing home, this means hav­ing to feed more mouths with dif­fer­ent tastes. Maybe on Mon­day, your lit­tle girl calls for chicken stew. On Tues­day? Some­thing a lit­tle more in­dul­gent for the spouse, per­haps.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this time, it is help­ful to plan ahead, while steering clear of hoard­ing or panic buy­ing.</p>
    <p>Gauge the fam­ily palate, plan meals so that ev­ery­one gets their fix as prac­ti­cally rea­son­able as pos­si­ble. Hav­ing said that, you should also re­mem­ber to cut your­self some slack as a par­ent. As such, it is very much okay to rely on food de­liv­ery ser­vices and take­out from time to time!</p>
    <p>Here are a few ways in which the men­tioned ser­vices may prove ben­e­fi­cial, and a nice change of pace from time to time. TAKE YOUR TIME</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest ben­e­fits of order­ing in is the abil­ity to take your time to choose what you want to eat. No rush, no bother, this also means more qual­ity time spent with the fam­ily. RIGHT TO YOUR DOORSTEP</p>
    <p>Need­less to say, food de­liv­ery en­tails just that – food de­liv­ered. No need to leave the home, just sit back and wait for your food to ar­rive. SPOILT FOR CHOICE</p>
    <p>Food de­liv­ery plat­forms pro­vide you with a wealth of tasty op­tions to choose from. The only draw­back is that with so many ideal choices on the table, opt­ing for one is al­ways go­ing to be a chal­lenge!</p>
