    <p>There has been a rush to hit the high seas, with 13 cruises to nowhere set­ting sail over the past month or so. The round-trip cruises with­out ports of call have taken 30,000 or so pas­sen­gers since Gent­ing Cruise Lines’ World Dream got the ball rolling on Nov 6.

    <p>There has been a rush to hit the high seas with 13 cruises to nowhere set­ting sail over the past month or so.</p>
    <p>The round-trip cruises with­out ports of call have taken 30,000 or so pas­sen­gers since Gent­ing Cruise Line’s World Dream got the ball rolling on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>The trips, which are part of a pilot pro­gramme an­nounced by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) in Oc­to­ber, im­pose strict mea­sures to keep Covid-19 at bay, in­clud­ing a re­duced 50 per cent ca­pac­ity and pre­board­ing test­ing for pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The two op­er­a­tors au­tho­rised to run such trips – Gent­ing Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional – told The Straits Times that tick­ets were selling well.</p>
    <p>The World Dream, which has run 11 cruises since its first one, of­fers two- and three-night “Su­per Sea­ca­tion” voy­ages. Its op­er­a­tor, Gent­ing, has ex­tended the itin­er­ar­ies to the end of March.</p>
    <p>“More Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents are in­creas­ingly be­com­ing aware of the start of World Dream’s safe pilot cruises... along with the ben­e­fits of cruis­ing,” said Mr Michael Goh, pres­i­dent of Dream Cruises and head of in­ter­na­tional sales at Gent­ing.</p>
    <p>“The re­sponses and en­quiries con­tinue to be very pos­i­tive and we re­main highly op­ti­mistic of the grow­ing de­mand dur­ing the school and fes­tive year-end hol­i­days.”</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean held a pilot cruise on the Quan­tum of the Seas on Nov 30, and last Thurs­day launched its first con­sumer-ori­ented voy­age since the out­break be­gan with a four-night get­away for 1,300 pas­sen­gers. The ves­sel sets sail again to­day on a three­night jaunt with 1,700 voy­agers.</p>
    <p>Ms Angie Stephen, man­ag­ing direc­tor for Asia-Pa­cific at Royal Caribbean, said: “The de­mand for our prod­uct has cer­tainly ex­ceeded our ex­pec­ta­tions. Sin­ga­pore is a great base of busi­ness, and we’re plan­ning on build­ing back con­fi­dence in the cruis­ing in­dus­try and ramp­ing up safely.”</p>
    <p>Ms Stephen said de­mand for its cruises from next month to March was al­ready build­ing up, with Jan­uary more than 50 per cent booked.</p>
    <p>She added that many cus­tomers are fam­i­lies and young pro­fes­sion­als with most pas­sen­gers aged 45 and un­der, while around 10 per cent are in their 60s and above.</p>
    <p>“There’s a lot of po­ten­tial, as we have a ca­pac­ity of 2,000 guests,” Ms Stephen said. “As for whether more ships will be added to the sail­ing ros­ter, we’d like to start safe and slow – but as Royal Caribbean has the most ships in the world, there’s al­ways an op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The need to get tested for the coro­n­avirus be­fore board­ing has not damp­ened the spir­its of ex­cited trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>“I much pre­fer cruis­ing to stay­ca­tions. De­spite there not be­ing ports of call, there’s loads to do on the boat,” said Mr Ricky Goh, 29, who is self-em­ployed and has been on two World Dream cruises. “Go­ing for a jog on the deck of a ship and watch­ing the sun­rise from the sea – these aren’t things you can do from a ho­tel room.”</p>
    <p>Mr Nishith Ku­mar, 66, a re­tiree from the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try, “can­not wait” to set sail on the Quan­tum of the Seas next month with his wife and 33-year-old son: “It’ll be a joy to travel once again with my fam­ily... I’m look­ing for­ward to ex­plor­ing the ship, re­lax­ing and breath­ing in some fresh ocean air.”</p>
    <p>The STB said in Oc­to­ber that pas­sen­gers must wear masks and ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing. “The Gov­ern­ment will mon­i­tor the out­comes of the pilot sail­ings care­fully in the com­ing months be­fore de­cid­ing on the next steps for cruises,” said STB cruise direc­tor An­nie Chang.</p>
