    <p>ROME • Paolo Rossi, Italy’s goalscor­ing hero from their vic­to­ri­ous 1982 World Cup cam­paign and scorer of a hat-trick against Brazil in one of the most fa­mous matches in the com­pe­ti­tion’s his­tory, yes­ter­day died at the age of 64.</p>
    <p>The cel­e­brated striker’s death comes with the foot­ball world still in mourn­ing for Ar­gentina icon Diego Maradona, who died last month of a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian TV chan­nel RAI Sport, where Rossi had been work­ing as a pun­dit, said “Pablito” had died of an “in­cur­able dis­ease”.</p>
    <p>Rossi’s wife, Fed­er­ica Cap­pel­letti, posted a photo of her­self and her hus­band on In­sta­gram along with the words “per sem­pre” or for­ever in Ital­ian.</p>
    <p>“There will never be any­one like you, unique, spe­cial...” she also wrote on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion (FIGC) pres­i­dent Gabriele Grav­ina said Rossi was “in­deli­bly linked to the blue shirt and his style of play in­spired many strik­ers of fu­ture gen­er­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>Rossi, whose lithe fig­ure be­lied his quick­ness and agility, won two Serie A ti­tles, a Euro­pean Cup and a Coppa Italia with Ju­ven­tus but will be most fondly re­mem­bered for light­ing up the 1982 World Cup in Spain with six goals.</p>
    <p>His Az­zurri se­lec­tion came after a two-year ban for a match-fix­ing scan­dal and was ini­tially crit­i­cised by pun­dits, who wrote him off as out of shape.</p>
    <p>But Rossi struck one of the World Cup’s great­est tre­bles and he later called his scor­ing streak “a per­sonal re­demp­tion”, hav­ing al­ways de­nied any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Brazil, led by Fal­cao, Socrates and Zico, were the tour­na­ment’s run­away favourites and had en­chanted the world with their flow­ing foot­ball.</p>
    <p>But Italy, via Rossi’s hero­ics, elim­i­nated the Sele­cao after a 3-2 up­set to move into the semi-fi­nals. He again made the dif­fer­ence against Poland, sink­ing them with a brace for a 2-0 win.</p>
    <p>That set up a fi­nal with West Ger­many and Rossi got Italy’s open­ing goal in a 3-1 vic­tory that gave them their third World Cup ti­tle and their first since 1938.</p>
    <p>He won both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball awards, a cam­paign re­garded as one of the best in­di­vid­ual World Cup per­for­mances of all time and was also awarded the 1982 Bal­lon d’Or as Europe’s top foot­baller.</p>
    <p>“This came out of the blue,” said for­mer goal­keeper and 1982 team­mate Dino Zoff, who is 78. “We’d heard some­thing was wrong but I didn’t think it was that se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>The one who beat Zico’s Brazil, Maradona’s Ar­gentina, Boniek’s Poland and in the fi­nal, the Ger­many of Rum­menigge.</p>
    <p>LA GAZZETTA DELLO SPORT, in an</p>
    <p>“I had a won­der­ful re­la­tion­ship with him, he was a lovely guy. This is some­thing which is dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>Another for­mer team­mate, Gian­carlo An­tognoni, added: “Another piece of his­tory of my beloved foot­ball has gone.”</p>
    <p>Rossi, who also scored three goals at the 1978 World Cup in Ar­gentina, re­mains Italy’s joint-high­est scorer in the tour­na­ment along­side Roberto Bag­gio and Chris­tian Vieri.</p>
    <p>He was in­cluded in the 1986 World Cup squad but did not play and ended his play­ing ca­reer a year later at 30 with Verona.</p>
    <p>News­pa­per La Gazzetta dello Sport said that Rossi was “the one who beat Zico’s Brazil, Maradona’s Ar­gentina, (Zbig</p>

    <p>For­mer Italy prime min­is­ter Mat­teo Renzi tweeted: “In our hearts, for­ever. Farewell Pablito”, while for­mer Italy coach Gio­vanni Tra­p­at­toni, who man­aged him at Juve, added: “Bye bye Paolo. Play­ers should never de­part be­fore coaches.”</p>
