    <p>When it comes to help­ing em­ploy­ees bal­ance work hours with re­lax­ation, Acu­ity In­sur­ance chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ben Salz­mann has an un­usual tool at his dis­posal: a 20m Fer­ris wheel.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic struck, he would reg­u­larly fire up the amuse­ment-park sta­ple in­side the com­pany’s head­quar­ters in Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>About twice a month, em­ploy­ees and their fam­i­lies could take a ride or two while drinks and child­friendly food were served.</p>
    <p>Af­ter-work social events like th­ese have been hall­marks of com­pa­nies look­ing to boost em­ployee morale and fos­ter a sense of com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>But those days are over for now and com­pa­nies in­ter­ested in keep­ing work­ers con­tent and pro­duc­tive face an un­prece­dented chal­lenge. Even among those em­ploy­ers that work­ers say han­dle work­life bal­ance best, adapt­ing to the work-from-home world has been a strug­gle.</p>
    <p>Some of the best com­pa­nies for work-life bal­ance have great paid­time-off poli­cies, flex­i­ble work­ing sched­ules, good parental leave, sab­bat­i­cals and gym cred­its. But as work­ers shifted to re­mote work, the spirit of in-per­son events and com­pany cul­ture needed to be recre­ated at home.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies are tak­ing very dif­fer­ent ap­proaches to main­tain­ing their worker-friendly rep­u­ta­tion, but a con­sis­tent theme has been mak­ing sure em­ploy­ees take time off.</p>
    <p>Whether be­cause they can­not go on a real va­ca­tion due to coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion fears or they sim­ply fear los­ing their job, many em­ploy­ees just won’t stop work­ing at a time when stress and burnout are likely off the charts.</p>
    <p>Hu­man re­source man­agers said sched­ule flex­i­bil­ity and sup­port­ing work­ing par­ents have been pop­u­lar so­lu­tions. Ex­tend­ing time-off poli­cies and help­ing em­ploy­ees bet­ter man­age work­loads were less com­mon ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies said they are even con­tem­plat­ing per­ma­nent shifts away from full-time of­fice work. Men­tal health has be­come more im­por­tant. Cal­i­for­nia-based Sur­vey­Mon­key has said that it added in­ter­nal pro­gram­ming for social iso­la­tion, po­ten­tial burnout and anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it also pro­vides con­fi­den­tial men­tal health ser­vices as well as “em­ployee as­sis­tance pro­grammes” that pro­vide fam­ily sup­port, le­gal and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The firm played to its strength, de­sign­ing ques­tion­naires for its own em­ploy­ees that ask how they are adapt­ing to work­ing re­motely. The com­pany has en­cour­aged work­ers to take breaks to pre­vent video-con­fer­enc­ing fa­tigue and pro­vided a US$500 (S$685) stipend for set­ting up a home of­fice.</p>
    <p>The stipend can also cover sub­scrip­tions to child­care ser­vice plat­forms, child­care ser­vices and other de­pen­dant care sup­port such as home nurses and aca­demic sub­scrip­tions for in-home school­ing, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>Sur­vey­Mon­key also has an un­lim­ited leave pol­icy called “re­spon­si­ble paid time off”, where em­ploy­ees de­cide how many va­ca­tion days they should take. Such poli­cies, how­ever, can some­times cause work­ers not to take time off, rather than risk be­ing seen as tak­ing too much. The com­pany sought to al­le­vi­ate this is­sue some­what by giv­ing em­ploy­ees a few “care flex days” to use in June.</p>
    <p>Some 70 per cent of em­ploy­ees took ad­van­tage of the pol­icy, said Ms Janelle Lopez, se­nior di­rec­tor of peo­ple at Sur­vey­Mon­key.</p>
    <p>Since April, all of San Fran­cis­cobased Slack’s em­ploy­ees have been get­ting a Fri­day off to­gether once per month – a change that the com­pany said it is keep­ing un­til the end of the year.</p>
    <p>When the com­pany CEO took a week off, he en­cour­aged those un­der him to do the same, said Mr Robby Kwok, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for peo­ple at Slack. “If your lead­ers are not tak­ing time off, it does not mat­ter how much you say to the com­pany. They’re go­ing to model that be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kwok’s def­i­ni­tion of work-life bal­ance boils down to em­ploy­ees hav­ing the flex­i­bil­ity they need to make room for both. Th­ese days, it means things like be­ing able to spend time with your chil­dren in the morn­ing, and then work­ing into the early evening to make up hours.</p>
    <p>Slack also cre­ated “emer­gency time off” so em­ploy­ees can deal with is­sues that come up dur­ing the pan­demic with­out us­ing up their va­ca­tion days, he said.</p>
    <p>One of the tra­di­tional ways of view­ing work-life bal­ance is how cleanly em­ploy­ees are able to dis­con­nect – an es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult propo­si­tion in the work-fromhome en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>At Slack, that means telling ev­ery new em­ployee that they should use the com­mu­ni­ca­tion plat­form’s “Do Not Dis­turb” func­tion to let oth­ers know they are un­avail­able – and not be ashamed of it. “Cul­tur­ally, we made that very ac­cept­able,” Mr Kwok said.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic even­tu­ally re­cedes, he ex­pects em­ploy­ees will want to re­tain their new flex­i­bil­ity, fur­ther in­te­grat­ing work-fromhome op­tions into ev­ery­day, post­pan­demic em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>At Acu­ity, those Fer­ris wheel rides have been re­placed by gift cards for restau­rants and lo­cal and on­line shop­ping. Fit­ness cen­tre ser­vices have now be­come virtual classes, the com­pany said. Pro­duc­tiv­ity and men­tor­ing have ac­tu­ally im­proved since re­mote work be­gan, Acu­ity con­tends – so much so that Mr Salz­mann re­cently told em­ploy­ees they could keep do­ing it per­ma­nently if they wanted.</p>
