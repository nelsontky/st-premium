    <p>Jurong Point and a FairPrice out­let in Alju­nied were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get people who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Singapore con­firmed four new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 57,915.</p>
    <p>All four, aged be­tween 18 and 41, were im­ported cases. They com­prise one Sin­ga­porean, one per­ma­nent res­i­dent, one stu­dent’s pass holder and one spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>Three of them had re­turned from In­dia, while the fourth had re­turned from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Singapore, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The number of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at four cases a week in the past fort­night, MOH added.</p>
    <p>The number of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from no cases in the week be­fore to two cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 12 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,804 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 34 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 34 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. There is none in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Singapore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
