    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States job growth slowed fur­ther last month as fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance from the gov­ern­ment ran out, threat­en­ing the econ­omy’s re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Non-farm pay­rolls in­creased by 1.371 mil­lion jobs last month af­ter ris­ing by 1.734 mil­lion in July, the Labour Depart­ment’s closely watched em­ploy­ment re­port showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate fell to 8.4 per cent from 10.2 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists polled by Reuters had fore­cast 1.4 mil­lion jobs added in Au­gust and the un­em­ploy­ment rate slid­ing to 9.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies from the trans­porta­tion to man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­tries have been an­nounc­ing lay­offs or fur­loughs, putting pres­sure on the White House and Congress to restart stalled ne­go­ti­a­tions for an­other fis­cal package.</p>
    <p>With just two months to go un­til the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, the jobs sit­u­a­tion likely will pro­vide po­lit­i­cal am­mu­ni­tion for both Democrats and Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>Pro­grammes to help busi­nesses pay wages have either lapsed or are on the verge of end­ing. A US$600 (S$820) weekly un­em­ploy­ment sup­ple­ment ex­pired in July.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists cred­ited gov­ern­ment largesse for the sharp re­bound in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity af­ter it nearly ground to a halt fol­low­ing the shut­ter­ing of busi­nesses in mid-March to con­trol the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s re­port is one of just two monthly labour mar­ket score­cards left on the cal­en­dar be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment growth peaked at 4.791 mil­lion in June. Most of the job gains stem from work­ers be­ing re­called from fur­loughs or tem­po­rary lay­offs.</p>
    <p>Though new Covid-19 in­fec­tions have sub­sided af­ter a broad resur­gence through the summer, many hot spots re­main.</p>
    <p>United Air­lines said on Wed­nes­day it was pre­par­ing to fur­lough 16,370 work­ers on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Air­lines has an­nounced its work­force would shrink by 40,000, in­clud­ing 19,000 in­vol­un­tary cuts.</p>
    <p>Ford Mo­tor said it was tar­get­ing 1,400 US salaried jobs for elim­i­na­tion by the year end.</p>
    <p>Mass tran­sit rail op­er­a­tors are also eye­ing fur­loughs.</p>
    <p>A re­port this week from the Fed­eral Re­serve based on in­for­ma­tion col­lected from the US cen­tral bank’s con­tacts on or be­fore Aug 24 showed an in­crease in em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The Fed, how­ever, noted that “some dis­tricts also re­ported slow­ing job growth and in­creased hir­ing volatil­ity, par­tic­u­larly in ser­vice in­dus­tries, with ris­ing in­stances of fur­loughed work­ers be­ing laid off per­ma­nently as de­mand re­mained soft.”</p>
