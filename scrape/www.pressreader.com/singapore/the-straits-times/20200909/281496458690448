    <p>Four days af­ter she was ac­quit­ted of steal­ing from the fam­ily of Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, a for­mer do­mes­tic worker has been cleared of all crim­i­nal charges.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the High Court over­turned the con­vic­tions against In­done­sian Parti Liyani, 46, on four theft charges over steal­ing about $34,000 worth of items.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms Parti was granted a dis­charge amount­ing to an ac­quit­tal for the fifth charge, for fraud­u­lent pos­ses­sion of prop­erty, at the State Courts af­ter the pros­e­cu­tion ap­plied to drop the charge against her.</p>
    <p>This charge is re­lated to 18 items in her pos­ses­sion that are not linked to the Liew fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was sus­pected of hav­ing “fraud­u­lently ob­tained” the items and was ac­cused of fail­ing to give a sat­is­fac­tory ac­count of how she ob­tained them.</p>
    <p>The items com­prised six ez-link cards, a pawn ticket, brand-name bags and wal­lets, two watches and fash­ion ac­ces­sories such as ear­rings and neck­laces.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the charge sheet, the items were of “un­known value”.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear if the brand-name goods, in­clud­ing a Miu Miu bag and two Prada wal­lets, were authen­tic.</p>
    <p>Th­ese items were found on her at the air­port when she re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in De­cem­ber 2016 to find work af­ter be­ing fired by the Liew fam­ily on Oct 28 that year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Ms Parti’s ac­quit­tal on the re­main­ing charge, her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, asked Dis­trict Judge Eddy Tham to or­der that the items listed in the charge be re­turned to her.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Gabriel Lim said he will sort this out “off­line” with the lawyer.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani also asked for Ms</p>
    <p>Parti’s in­for­ma­tion to be re­moved from the crim­i­nal reg­istry.</p>
    <p>The dis­trict judge re­jected this ap­pli­ca­tion, say­ing that she can take ac­tion if th­ese charges are sub­se­quently held against her.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the hear­ing, a spokesman for the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nomics told re­porters that Mr Parti will re­turn to In­done­sia af­ter re­solv­ing ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti has been stay­ing at the shel­ter run by the mi­grant work­ers’ group since she came back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In March last year, Ms Parti was found guilty on four counts of theft and sen­tenced to jail for two years and two months.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, High Court judge</p>
    <p>Chan Seng Onn al­lowed her ap­peal. In a 100-page judg­ment, he found that the trial judge’s de­ci­sion to con­vict her was un­safe.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons in­cluded how the ev­i­dence was han­dled by the Liew fam­ily mem­bers be­fore they were pho­tographed by the po­lice five weeks later, and that two po­lice state­ments were taken from the In­done­sian with­out an in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan also found that there was im­proper mo­tive on the part of Mr Liew and his son Karl in mak­ing a po­lice re­port against Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, the po­lice and the Min­istry of Man­power are now look­ing into the case.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Ms Parti’s ac­quit­tal on the re­main­ing charge, her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, asked Dis­trict Judge Eddy Tham to or­der that the items listed in the charge be re­turned to her. Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Gabriel Lim said he will sort this out “off­line” with the lawyer. Mr Balchan­dani also asked for Ms Parti’s in­for­ma­tion to be re­moved from the crim­i­nal reg­istry. The dis­trict judge re­jected this ap­pli­ca­tion, say­ing that she can take ac­tion if th­ese charges are sub­se­quently held against her.</p>
