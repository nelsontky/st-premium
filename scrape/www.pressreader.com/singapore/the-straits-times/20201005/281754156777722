    <p>WASHINGTON • When Dr Sean Con­ley stepped in front of the cam­eras at Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre last Satur­day, he de­liv­ered a brief­ing that seemed in­tended less to in­form the Amer­i­can pub­lic than to sat­isfy the pub­lic re­la­tions de­mands of a fa­mous and fa­mously de­mand­ing pa­tient – Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>“He’s do­ing great,” he said.</p>
    <p>But mo­ments later, the Pres­i­dent’s chief of staff, Mr Mark Mead­ows, speak­ing off cam­era and on the as­sump­tion he would not be iden­ti­fied, of­fered a con­tra­dic­tory as­sess­ment, not­ing “the Pres­i­dent’s vi­tals over the last 24 hours were very con­cern­ing, and the next 48 hours will be crit­i­cal in terms of his care”.</p>
    <p>“We’re still not on a clear path to a full re­cov­ery,” he added.</p>
    <p>The rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent mes­sage was stun­ning – and at first at­trib­uted, at Mr Mead­ows’ in­sis­tence, to “a source fa­mil­iar with the Pres­i­dent’s health” speak­ing on back­ground, but later iden­ti­fied as the chief of staff.</p>
    <p>The dis­cor­dant state­ments were a re­veal­ing in­sight into the dy­nam­ics be­hind the Trump White House’s fre­quent re­lease of mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion, par­tic­u­larly about the Pres­i­dent’s health.</p>
    <p>Dr Con­ley is a US Navy doc­tor, and Mr Trump is not only his pa­tient but his com­man­der in chief.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent is known to be es­pe­cially in­ter­ested in pre­sent­ing his health in the best pos­si­ble light, and his health has never been an is­sue the way it is now.</p>
    <p>For Mr Mead­ows, the clar­i­fi­ca­tion ap­peared to be an ef­fort to lay some ground­work for the pos­si­bil­ity that Mr Trump’s con­di­tion could worsen, rais­ing the prospect of a po­ten­tial trans­fer of power to Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence un­der the 25th Amend­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Mead­ows, a for­mer con­gress­man from North Carolina, also may have been con­cerned about his own cred­i­bil­ity with jour­nal­ists in a post-Trump po­lit­i­cal world.</p>
    <p>But the net re­sult of the two con­flict­ing ac­counts was that in the mid­dle of a pan­demic and elec­tion that have ac­cen­tu­ated the dis­trust of the gov­ern­ment by both left and right, the Amer­i­can pub­lic does not have a de­fin­i­tive an­swer to the con­di­tion of the first pres­i­dent to be hos­pi­talised since Mr Ron­ald Rea­gan.</p>
    <p>While mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion has been a hall­mark of the Trump pres­i­dency, the White House physi­cian – Dr Con­ley, and be­fore him, Dr Ronny L. Jack­son – has been put in a par­tic­u­larly awk­ward po­si­tion and pro­vided murky, in­ac­cu­rate and some­times in­ap­pro­pri­ate ac­counts of Mr Trump’s health that have in­cluded a de­scrip­tion, in Dr Jack­son’s case, of the Pres­i­dent’s “in­cred­i­ble genes”.</p>
    <p>All have been in ser­vice of a pres­i­dent who has re­fused to dis­close any de­tails about his phys­i­cal con­di­tion that would un­der­mine the nar­ra­tive that, de­spite his age, 74; a diet that is heavy on fast food; and a deep aver­sion to ex­er­cise, he has the stamina and strength of a man half his age.</p>
    <p>Hours af­ter Dr Con­ley’s Satur­day news con­fer­ence, dur­ing which he dodged ques­tions about whether the Pres­i­dent had been on oxy­gen and in­ac­cu­rately sug­gested that Mr Trump was only “slightly over­weight”, Dr Con­ley was forced to is­sue a correction on some of his re­marks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter say­ing the Pres­i­dent had been di­ag­nosed 72 hours be­fore, which would have meant that Mr Trump con­tin­ued with a nor­mal sched­ule of ral­lies and fund-rais­ers de­spite know­ing he was ill, Dr Con­ley re­tracted the time­line.</p>
    <p>“I in­cor­rectly used the term ‘72 hours’ in­stead of ‘Day 3’,” with re­gard to Mr Trump’s di­ag­no­sis, he said, adding that the Pres­i­dent first tested pos­i­tive last Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>The in­ac­cu­rate and mis­lead­ing brief­ing from the White House physi­cian last Satur­day was a dis­ap­point­ment to some ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, who had pushed for Dr Con­ley to take over as the pub­lic face of the cur­rent news cy­cle, hop­ing he would be seen as a more cred­i­ble source than Ms Kayleigh McE­nany, the White House press sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>But cred­i­bil­ity has never been a strong suit of the doc­tors that Mr Trump re­lies on.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Repub­li­can pri­mary in 2015, Mr Trump’s doc­tor at the time, Dr Harold Born­stein, re­leased a l et­ter stat­ing that Mr Trump’s health was “ex­cel­lent” and that “if elected, Mr Trump, I can state un­equiv­o­cally, will be the health­i­est in­di­vid­ual ever elected to the pres­i­dency”.</p>
    <p>Later, he told CNN how the let­ter had come about. Mr Trump, he said, had “dic­tated that whole let­ter. I didn’t write that let­ter”.</p>
