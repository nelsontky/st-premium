    <p>HON­EST THIEF</p>
    <p>A movie with a poster in which Liam Neeson holds a gun must sound like mu­sic to the ears of cin­ema op­er­a­tors now.</p>
    <p>In a time when Hol­ly­wood ma­jors are re­leas­ing next to noth­ing, a movie with the North­ern Ir­ish ac­tor do­ing the thing he is most known for – wreak­ing havoc – must be the clos­est thing to a sum­mer block­buster.</p>
    <p>On the sur­face, at least,</p>
    <p>Tom Carter feels like a clas­sic kill-them-all Neeson char­ac­ter. Once a bank rob­ber, he has since given up the trade af­ter meet­ing the woman of his dreams.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing a clean slate, he tries to turn him­self in. Things do not work as planned, forc­ing him to go un­der­ground while try­ing to pro­tect the peo­ple he cares about and clear his name.</p>
    <p>Not the most novel of plots, but one that gives clever film-mak­ers plenty of space to in­ject their sig­na­ture flour­ishes such as stunts, fights, gad­gets, ex­plo­sions and car chases – the vis­ual touches that make a movie spe­cial.</p>
    <p>None of that costly eye candy can be found here.</p>
    <p>In­stead, what un­folds is a twisty story about a man com­ing clean to his fi­ance An­nie (Kate Walsh), cop­ing with her trust is­sues while re­veal­ing bits of his crooked past to se­cure his safety in the present.</p>
    <p>There are only a few ac­tion-movie stunts here, with much of the time taken up by dou­ble crosses and Carter flee­ing im­mi­nent cap­ture.</p>
    <p>The film feels small-scale and un­am­bi­tious, an ex­pe­ri­ence made worse by lazy thriller writ­ing that deals in fan­tas­tic co­in­ci­dences and the ul­tra-com­pe­tent Carter be­hav­ing ir­ra­tionally at con­ve­nient points in the story.</p>
    <p>THE SUN­LIT NIGHT</p>
    <p>There are gen­tle come­dies. Then there is The Sun­lit Night, a com­edy so gen­tle, it should come with a “do not con­sume while op­er­at­ing heavy ma­chin­ery” warn­ing.</p>
    <p>It be­gins promis­ingly enough: Frances (Jenny Slate) is a New</p>
    <p>York City artist stuck in a rut, emo­tion­ally and cre­atively.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing a fresh start, she grabs an ap­pren­tice­ship po­si­tion in Nor­way.</p>
    <p>In the northerly place where the sun sets for a few brief hours each night, she meets a bunch of ec­centrics who have cho­sen to set­tle there.</p>
    <p>This is a story that begs to be cute – there is no other word to de­scribe movies about mid­dle-class Amer­i­can women trav­el­ling to “ex­otic” lo­cales to re­set their cul­tural, culi­nary or ro­man­tic com­passes.</p>
    <p>Ger­man direc­tor David Wnendt, work­ing with a screenplay by Re­becca Din­er­stein based on her novel of the same name, in­tends for the film to be the art-house antidote to gen­tle come­dies, such as the likes of Lost In Trans­la­tion (2003) and Eat Pray Love (2010).</p>
    <p>Anti-cute­ness is fine – movie­go­ers can all use a break from see­ing trans­planted New York­ers frol­ick­ing un­der the Tus­can sun, rolling their eyes in ec­stasy af­ter bit­ing into a real Parisian brioche or feel­ing blue in frigid Tokyo – but does it have to be so bland?</p>
    <p>Strong comedic ac­tors like</p>
    <p>Slate – along with Zach Gal­i­fi­anakis and Gil­lian An­der­son play­ing ex­pa­tri­ate odd­balls she meets up north – look lost and un­sure with­out the usual strong foils play­ing op­po­site them. They are boxed in by char­ac­ters gifted with vary­ing lev­els of weird­ness.</p>
    <p>But when ev­ery­one is weird, no one is.</p>
    <p>NUM­BER 1/THE EMPTY MAN/ THE GOLDEN HOL­I­DAY</p>
    <p>Other movies open­ing this week, but not re­viewed here in­clude the Man­darin mu­si­cal com­edy Num­ber 1, which stars Mark Lee as an ev­ery­man who, af­ter tak­ing a job as a man­ager in a drag club, tries be­com­ing a queen him­self. The Straits Times will do a re­view on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In su­per­nat­u­ral mys­tery</p>
    <p>The Empty Man, a re­tired cop played by James Badge Dale looks into the case of miss­ing teens in a small town, be­lieved to have been taken by a res­i­dent called The Empty Man.</p>
    <p>In Korean com­edy The Golden Hol­i­day, a cop (Kwak Do-won) and his fam­ily go to Manila for a hol­i­day, but the de­tec­tive’s real pur­pose is to col­lect a debt from a con­man (Kim Sang-ho). But the orig­i­nal mis­sion is put aside when the crook con­vinces the cop that there is hid­den trea­sure to be found.</p>
