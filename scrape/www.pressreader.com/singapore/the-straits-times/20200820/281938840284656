    <p>LON­DON • Mar­riott In­ter­na­tional, the world’s largest ho­tel op­er­a­tor, is fac­ing a Lon­don class ac­tion law­suit brought by mil­lions of for­mer ho­tel guests de­mand­ing com­pen­sa­tion after their per­sonal data was hacked in one of the largest data breaches in his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin Bryant, founder of tech­nol­ogy and me­dia con­sul­tancy Big Revo­lu­tion, is lead­ing the claim for English- and Welsh-domi­ciled guests after more than 300 mil­lion cus­tomer records from Mar­riott’s global data­base, po­ten­tially in­clud­ing pass­port and credit card de­tails, were hacked be­tween 2014 and 2018.</p>
    <p>“I hope this case will raise aware­ness of the value of our per­sonal data, re­sult in fair com­pen­sa­tion... and also serve no­tice to other data own­ers that they must hold our data re­spon­si­bly,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The law­suit, which seeks un­spec­i­fied dam­ages for loss of con­trol of per­sonal data, au­to­mat­i­cally in­cludes guests who made a reser­va­tion at any of the for­mer Star­wood brand ho­tels – in­clud­ing Sher­a­ton Ho­tels & Re­sorts and St Regis ho­tels – be­fore Sept 10, 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryant is rep­re­sented by law firm Haus­feld, and the case is funded by Har­bour Lit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Around seven mil­lion United King­dom guest records were in­volved, ac­cord­ing to the In­for­ma­tion Com­mis­sioner’s Of­fice, which last year pro­posed a £99.2 mil­lion (S$178.9 mil­lion) fine over the breach.</p>
    <p>A Lon­don-based spokesman for Mar­riott was not im­me­di­ately avail­able for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mar­riott an­nounced in 2018 that hack­ers had ac­cessed its Star­wood ho­tels reser­va­tion data­base.</p>
    <p>It no­ti­fied the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“We fell short of what our guests de­serve,” chief ex­ec­u­tive Arne</p>
    <p>Soren­son said at the time.</p>
    <p>At­tor­neys filed a law­suit in a Mary­land fed­eral court within hours of the dis­clo­sure. Oth­ers fol­lowed suit in the United States and Canada.</p>
    <p>The Lon­don class ac­tion has been filed in the High Court after a land­mark Court of Ap­peal de­ci­sion last Oc­to­ber that a col­lec­tive ac­tion could be served against In­ter­net gi­ant Google over al­leged un­law­ful track­ing of iPhone users in 2011 and 2012 through third-party cook­ies.</p>
    <p>Google is ap­peal­ing.</p>
