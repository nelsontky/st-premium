    <p>Work­ers aged 35 to 44 have borne the brunt of the Covid-19 pan­demic, with its dis­mal eco­nomic cli­mate hav­ing taken a heavy toll on their salar­ies.</p>
    <p>More than a quar­ter of these work­ers have seen their in­comes de­cline in re­cent months. Among them, 56 per cent saw their in­comes plunge by more than 30 per cent, ac­cord­ing to a DBS Bank report.</p>
    <p>These work­ers, who form the bulk of Sin­ga­pore’s work­force, en­joy fewer sup­port mea­sures com­pared with older work­ers, said DBS Group Re­search se­nior econ­o­mist Irvin Seah, a team mem­ber be­hind the report.</p>
    <p>At the same time, those aged 35 to 44 face higher com­pe­ti­tion from their younger peers and their rel­a­tively higher wages also make them sus­cep­ti­ble to wage cuts, he added.</p>
    <p>The DBS report was based on macroe­co­nomic data and anonymised find­ings from 1.2 mil­lion re­tail cus­tomers aged 25 to 70 who use DBS as their main salary cred­it­ing bank, over the March to May pe­riod. Work per­mit hold­ers were ex­cluded from the anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>The report also found that low­er­in­come work­ers – those who earn less than $3,000 per month – make up al­most half of cus­tomers who have ex­pe­ri­enced a fall in salar­ies. Within this group, 51 per cent saw their in­comes fall by more than half.</p>
    <p>In May, a larger pro­por­tion of cus­tomers – 26 per cent – saw their in­comes shrink by over 10 per cent, com­pared with 15 per cent of them in March.</p>
    <p>Among them, about a third saw their in­comes plunge by more than half.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple also do not have suf­fi­cient sav­ings to tide them over as they ex­pe­ri­ence a loss in earn­ings. In May, 64 per cent of work­ers who had ex­pe­ri­enced a sig­nif­i­cant fall in in­come had less than three months of emer­gency funds, and 27 per cent had less than a month of such funds.</p>
    <p>In terms of sec­tors, the avi­a­tion sec­tor saw the largest spike in work­ers whose in­comes de­te­ri­o­rated, with 81 per cent of peo­ple em­ployed in the sec­tor ex­pe­ri­enc­ing lower in­comes in May, up from 39 per cent in March.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day, Mr Seah called the Covid-19 pan­demic “a highly re­gres­sive event which could po­ten­tially widen the in­come gap in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>He said: “Its im­pact on the var­i­ous in­come groups has been dis­parate and un­even, and as we have found, skew un­favourably towards lower-in­come earn­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mea­sures such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme have helped to mit­i­gate job losses, he added, “but more tar­geted pol­icy in­ter­ven­tion may be re­quired to pro­vide cal­i­brated as­sis­tance to those that are worst af­fected”.</p>
    <p>De­spite the pan­demic’s ad­verse im­pact on in­comes, one sil­ver lin­ing is that more re­tail in­vestors sought to grow their wealth by buy­ing stocks when the eq­uity mar­kets plunged in March.</p>
    <p>They shifted sig­nif­i­cantly towards eq­ui­ties, and away from bonds and unit trusts, noted the report, which was jointly pro­duced by DBS Group Re­search and DBS Fi­nan­cial Plan­ning Group for the bank’s new DBS NAV Fi­nan­cial Health Se­ries of re­search re­ports.</p>
