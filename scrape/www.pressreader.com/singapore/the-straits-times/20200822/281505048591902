    <p>Can­di­dates con­test­ing this year’s gen­eral elec­tion (GE) spent more than $9 mil­lion on cam­paign­ing, with the bulk of the money go­ing to­wards posters, ban­ners, fliers and on­line ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>Par­ties also spent just over $200,000 on “non-print elec­tion ad­ver­tis­ing”, which can re­fer to the cost of de­sign­ing, for ex­am­ple, a party’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Ex­penses sub­mit­ted to the Elec­tions De­part­ment (ELD) show that the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) spent $6.97 mil­lion on the 93 seats it con­tested, while the 10 op­po­si­tion par­ties and sin­gle in­de­pen­dent can­di­date spent a com­bined sum of $2.19 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The to­tal ex­penses mark a nearly 30 per cent in­crease over the sum in the 2015 polls, when can­di­dates spent around $7.1 mil­lion al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the ELD opened its elec­tion ex­penses records for pub­lic in­spec­tion, with mem­bers of the me­dia among the first to pe­ruse the doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Although over­all ex­penses rose this year, all can­di­dates still spent sig­nif­i­cantly be­low the al­lowed max­i­mum of $4 per voter.</p>
    <p>The PAP was the big­gest spender, chalk­ing up $2.63 per voter. It was fol­lowed by the Work­ers’ Party (WP) with $1.21, and Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) with $1.19.</p>
    <p>The PSP, which fielded the largest op­po­si­tion con­tin­gent in its maiden elec­toral con­test, was the big­gest over­all spender among the op­po­si­tion par­ties. Its 24 can­di­dates, spread out over nine con­stituen­cies, spent $781,275.</p>
    <p>The WP came next, at $705,647. It con­tested 21 seats across six con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>Peo­ples Voice and Red Dot United spent the least per voter, at 13 cents and 10 cents, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The sole in­de­pen­dent can­di­date who con­tested sin­gle-seat Pioneer, Mr Cheang Peng Wah, spent $31,537 on his cam­paign, work­ing out to $1.28 per voter.</p>
    <p>There were 2,651,435 reg­is­tered vot­ers in the July 10 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates are re­quired by law to sub­mit their elec­tion ex­penses, to en­sure ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency in cam­paign fi­nance.</p>
    <p>But un­like pre­vi­ous years, can­di­dates’ ex­pense re­ceipts were not in­cluded in this year’s records. These re­ceipts have, in the past, thrown up in­ter­est­ing tid­bits of in­for­ma­tion about can­di­dates’ spend­ing habits.</p>
    <p>In 2015, for in­stance, for­mer Bukit Pan­jang MP Teo Ho Pin spent $9,160 on catered lunch and din­ner buf­fets for his volunteers over the nine-day cam­paign pe­riod.</p>
    <p>That year also saw Mr Lee Hong Chuang, the PAP’s Hougang can­di­date, sub­mit a $40 re­ceipt for the re­pair of dam­aged lights in a staff room. And the National Sol­i­dar­ity Party team con­test­ing Sem­bawang GRC spent $1,125 on bal­loon clappers with the party’s name on them.</p>
    <p>In­stead, this year’s records gave an over­view of can­di­dates’ spend­ing in dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories, such as elec­tion ad­ver­tise­ments, trans­port, and of­fice ren­tal and sup­plies. About $5.6 mil­lion was spent on print ads – most of which came from the PAP – com­pared with about $2 mil­lion on on­line ads.</p>
    <p>The WP, de­spite its very suc­cess­ful so­cial me­dia cam­paign, did not spend any money on paid In­ter­net ads, although it spent nearly $600,000 on print ones.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party, on the other hand, spent al­most the same amount on paid In­ter­net ads as it did on phys­i­cal ones. In all, it spent nearly $280,000 on such ads.</p>
    <p>“So­cial me­dia is meant to com­ple­ment what’s hap­pen­ing on the ground rather than be a sub­sti­tute,” said Dr Mustafa Iz­zud­din, a se­nior in­ter­na­tional af­fairs an­a­lyst at man­age­ment con­sul­tancy firm So­laris Strate­gies Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I think what the par­ties have done is that they have kept the tra­di­tional method of cam­paign­ing, but added an on­line el­e­ment.”</p>
    <p>Par­ties con­tinue to give out fliers and brochures be­cause they are some­thing “tan­gi­ble” that can be left with the voter, sug­gested As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan of the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>He noted that the WP’s elec­tion video clips were widely shared de­spite its de­ci­sion not to in­vest in paid In­ter­net ads. This demon­strates the power of a good on­line cam­paign, said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very good learn­ing point,” he added. “It sug­gests you need some­thing that will get peo­ple en­gaged and talk­ing.”</p>
    <p>The ex­penses records are avail­able for in­spec­tion for six months, un­til Feb 20. A pay­ment of $2 is re­quired to inspect each can­di­date’s re­turns.</p>
