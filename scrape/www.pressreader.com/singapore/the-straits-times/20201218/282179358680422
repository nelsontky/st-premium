    <p>They were friends, but af­ter a night out, he mo­lested the 25-year-old woman in her home, leav­ing her feel­ing “so shocked and scared that she could not move”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Sin­ga­porean of­fender, now 30, pleaded guilty in a district court to one count of mo­lesta­tion.</p>
    <p>He can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the vic­tim’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the pair had a drink­ing ses­sion with other friends around 9pm on Nov 15 last year, be­fore leav­ing the bar around 1am.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim in­vited the man and two other friends to her home in a Mount Ver­non Road con­do­minium to hang out.</p>
    <p>One of the friends left the unit around 3am, while the other fell asleep on a sofa in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>The of­fender asked the woman if he could stay overnight, and when she agreed, they con­tin­ued chat­ting in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Daniel Ling said: “The ac­cused and t he vic­tim talked about ‘spoon­ing’, which is a sex­ual topic. Af­ter some time, both the vic­tim and the ac­cused fell asleep on the liv­ing room floor.</p>
    <p>“Some time later, the vic­tim woke up and re­alised that the ac­cused was hug­ging her from be­hind.”</p>
    <p>She left the liv­ing room to use the toi­let and then fell asleep in her own bed­room. But she left the door to the room open.</p>
    <p>The man woke up soon af­ter and moved to her bed. The vic­tim was shocked to find him rest­ing be­side her. The man slipped his left hand into his friend’s top and mo­lested her.</p>
    <p>DPP Ling told the court: “Scared and fright­ened, the vic­tim took the op­por­tu­nity to roll away from the ac­cused and faced away from him. The vic­tim felt dis­gusted and out­raged.</p>
    <p>“Soon af­ter, the ac­cused’s alarm went off, in­di­cat­ing that it was about 6.30am. The ac­cused got up from the vic­tim’s bed and left the (unit).”</p>
    <p>The woman told her boyfriend, who was then study­ing over­seas, about her or­deal be­fore alert­ing the po­lice on Nov 21 last year.</p>
    <p>DPP Ling pressed for the of­fender to be sen­tenced to at least eight months’ jail with up to three strokes of the cane, stress­ing that the of­fence in­volved skin-to-skin con­tact.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer Lim Kia Tong pleaded for his client to be given six months’ jail with no can­ing. He said that his client is re­morse­ful and that the of­fence was not pre­med­i­tated.</p>
    <p>The of­fender will be sen­tenced next Wed­nes­day.</p>
