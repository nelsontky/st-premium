    <p>GO AHEAD</p>
    <p>One of the most talked-about Chi­nese dra­mas this year is Go Ahead, which looks at what de­fines a fam­ily, and has at its heart an un­con­ven­tional fam­ily brought to­gether by love as much as cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Wi­dower Li Haichao is very much a dream dad if not quite a dream boat. He is kept busy run­ning a neigh­bour­hood noo­dle shop, but never fails to pre­pare three meals for his young daugh­ter Jian­jian.</p>
    <p>When the cou­ple up­stairs – po­lice­man Ling Heping and wife Chen Ting – keep hav­ing fights, Li in­vites their trou­bled son Ling Xiao home for meals. Wrecked by guilt over the death of her daugh­ter, Chen later walks out on the mar­riage and leaves be­hind her son.</p>
    <p>An­other boy, He Ziqiu, ends up liv­ing with Li af­ter his sin­gle mother He Mei – whom Li is in­tro­duced to by a matchmaker – leaves the boy in his care. She prom­ises to go back for him, but never does.</p>
    <p>Li sud­denly finds him­self be­com­ing a fa­ther not just to his daugh­ter, but also the two boys.</p>
    <p>The three chil­dren grow up to­gether and be­come closer than most bi­o­log­i­cal sib­lings. Po­lice­man Ling com­pletes this un­usual fam­ily unit, leav­ing his son in Li’s care and join­ing in for meals.</p>
    <p>The early episodes of this drama are suf­fused with charm – ac­tor Tu Songyan ra­di­ates warmth as Li, who loves cook­ing and tak­ing care of chil­dren. The young ac­tors play­ing the chil­dren are nat­u­rals, es­pe­cially the two boys who man­age to con­vey their char­ac­ters’ feel­ings of hurt.</p>
    <p>The three chil­dren hang out and at­tend high school to­gether, but are forced to part when the bi­o­log­i­cal par­ents of Ling Xiao and He Ziqiu re­turn for them.</p>
    <p>The baby-faced ac­tress Seven Tan, who has made a name for her­self play­ing child-like char­ac­ters, is a ball of en­ergy and a bag of laughs as the adult Jian­jian.</p>
    <p>There are many laughs to be had, with Jian­jian’s wacky an­tics and the use of comic sound ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The show’s writ­ing is a cut above the rest, with its poignant ob­ser­va­tion, for ex­am­ple, on how peo­ple drift apart and are left with lit­tle to say to each other – and this awk­ward­ness is of­ten am­pli­fied by in­stant mes­sag­ing tools.</p>
    <p>But the drama be­comes a lit­tle cringy when it de­scends into idol-drama cliche – Jian­jian’s two non-bi­o­log­i­cal broth­ers re­turn af­ter be­ing away for years and both de­clare their love for her.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Song Wei­long has the req­ui­site height and brood­ing good looks as the adult Ling Xiao, whom Jian­jian chooses over He Ziqiu.</p>
    <p>But it is the sec­ond male lead Zhang Xincheng who shows more depth and range as He.</p>
    <p>While its cen­tral ro­mance feels forced, the show re­mains highly watch­able and binge-wor­thy. It is an earnest valen­tine to fam­i­lies – both by birth or by choice.</p>
    <p>NOTH­ING BUT THIRTY</p>
    <p>An­other Chi­nese drama which has made waves is Noth­ing But Thirty, which fol­lows three women in their 30s based in Shang­hai. It has won fans for its re­al­is­tic de­pic­tion of the chal­lenges faced by mid­dle-class women of a cer­tain age in China.</p>
    <p>When the show begins, Gu Jia (Tong Yao), her busi­ness­man hus­band and son are pre­par­ing to up­grade to a lux­ury apart­ment in cen­tral Shang­hai. She has set her sights on mov­ing up the so­cial lad­der and get­ting her son into an ex­clu­sive pre-school taught by ex­pa­tri­ates.</p>
    <p>Her close friend Zhong Xiao­qin (Rachel Mao), an of­fice worker who is mar­ried with no kids, is nowhere as am­bi­tious and is of­ten taken ad­van­tage of at work for be­ing help­ful.</p>
    <p>Zhong works in the same build­ing as Wang Manni (Mag­gie Jiang), a sin­gle woman who uses her wits to rise up the ranks at a lux­ury bou­tique chain.</p>
    <p>The drama, which fol­lows its three fe­male leads as they nav­i­gate love and ca­reer, of­fers a riv­et­ing look at the clash be­tween money and moral­ity in China.</p>
    <p>In a pow­er­ful scene, a shab­bily dressed mid­dle-aged woman goes into the bou­tique Wang works at, to splash out on jew­ellery. She is ex­cited ini­tially at the prospect of a fat com­mis­sion – and pro­mo­tion – but has mixed emo­tions af­ter the woman tells her she came into money be­cause her hus­band di­vorced her for an­other woman.</p>
    <p>Wang won­ders if she should stop the woman from frit­ter­ing her for­tune away – but de­cides not to do any­thing in the end.</p>
    <p>For a grip­ping and well-writ­ten drama that of­fers in­sight into the pres­sures faced by mid­dle-class women in China, look no fur­ther.</p>
