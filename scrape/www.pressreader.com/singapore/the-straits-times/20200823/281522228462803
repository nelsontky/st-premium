    <p>For more than 20 years, pup­pet master Frankie Yeo has per­formed with his hand pup­pets and an­i­mated mar­i­onettes at chil­dren’s par­ties, com­pany events and theatre pro­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Call­ing them his “ba­bies”, the 57-year-old crafted many of these dolls by hand, work­ing on some for up to two years.</p>
    <p>Now, how­ever, it is time to say good­bye.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Sin­ga­porean, whose stage name is Frankie Malachi, made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to sell some of his pup­pets to pay his bills.</p>
    <p>For months now, live per­for­mances have been can­celled to help curb the spread of Covid-19, hit­ting many in the arts com­mu­nity hard.</p>
    <p>On the heart­break­ing de­ci­sion, the cre­ative di­rec­tor of home­grown com­pany Mas­cots and Pup­pets Spe­cial­ists says: “I have no choice. The pan­demic is drag­ging on much longer than I ex­pected and I do not know when I will be able to next put on a pup­pet show.”</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 hit, he thought it would come and go quickly like the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome. “But it has been some time and there are still no events in sight. I will miss my beloved ba­bies, but selling them is the only way I can think of to keep the com­pany afloat.”</p>
    <p>His costs in­clude the five-fig­ure monthly rental of his 3,300 sq ft ware­house space in MacPher­son In­dus­trial Com­plex, where he has been oper­at­ing since 2008. There are also the salaries of his three em­ploy­ees, which he was forced to cut by 30 per cent since this month.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the last few months have been filled with one dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion after another.</p>
    <p>He has to fur­lough one staff mem­ber from next month. “I felt really bad be­cause he had been sav­ing up every dol­lar for his up­com­ing wed­ding. Never have I sacked or laid off any­body in my life.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo him­self has not drawn an in­come since April, and nei­ther has his wife, the busi­ness’ co-owner.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance has helped, he ac­knowl­edges. “But with no in­come com­ing in, things are still very dif­fi­cult. Apart from cut­ting costs, there is very lit­tle we can do ex­cept hope things get bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>For pup­peteers like him­self, per­form­ing on­line shows is not vi­able, he says. “Videos just can­not cap­ture the spon­tane­ity and in­ter­ac­tion of live per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>Go­ing on­line would also mean com­pet­ing with nu­mer­ous en­ter­tain­ment op­tions – from Net­flix to YouTube.</p>
    <p>“On­line shows are not com­mer­cially sound,” he adds. “It is very hard to get ne­ti­zens to pay for a show streamed on­line.”</p>
    <p>What if the pan­demic drags on? “I don’t want to think of that,” says Mr Yeo, who has heard of artists be­ing forced to move out of their premises. “Thank­fully, we have not reached that stage yet. But if this sit­u­a­tion is pro­longed, the fu­ture is very un­cer­tain.”</p>
    <p>For now, he is pric­ing his pup­pets at dis­counted rates of $300 to $2,300. He is also happy to give buy­ers a one-to-one tu­to­rial – ei­ther in per­son or on­line – on how to op­er­ate them.</p>
    <p>Yet, only two dolls have been sold so far.</p>
    <p>“Many po­ten­tial buy­ers are them­selves fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties and tight­en­ing their belts. They say they want to buy, but do not have the money.”</p>
    <p>None­the­less, Mr Yeo has never re­gret­ted his de­ci­sion to pur­sue pup­pet-mak­ing as a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>The former air­craft me­chanic, who also did a stint in ad­ver­tis­ing, started mak­ing pup­pets in 1995, mainly through trial and er­ror.</p>
    <p>In 2003, he set up his com­pany and went into mak­ing pup­pets and mas­cots full time.</p>
    <p>Over the years, his pup­pets have been used in nu­mer­ous events, such as the 2015 edi­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Night Fes­ti­val, and theatre pro­duc­tions such as the 2018 mu­si­cal Alke­sah and 2009 mu­si­cal comedy H For Hantu.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo has also made gi­ant pup­pets – which have to be op­er­ated by more than one per­son – for the 2009 and 2011 Na­tional Day Pa­rades.</p>
    <p>Last year, he did at least 150 per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>Although times are hard now, he says: “I am an artist and we al­ways be­lieve in hope.</p>
    <p>“I have ded­i­cated my whole life to per­fect­ing my craft and I will not stop try­ing to keep pup­petry alive for chil­dren and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo will be glad to know that some live per­for­mances might be al­lowed soon.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) said last Fri­day that plans to re­sume such per­for­mances are un­der way.</p>
    <p>MCCY and the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) will work closely with key stake­hold­ers to ex­plore com­mis­sion­ing and pro­gram­ming pi­lots of small-scale per­for­mances, it was re­vealed. More in­for­ma­tion will be made avail­able by the NAC later.</p>
