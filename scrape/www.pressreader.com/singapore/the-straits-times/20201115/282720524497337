    <p>A Un­der the Em­ploy­ment Act, your em­ployer must pay your salary within seven days after the end of a salary pe­riod, which can­not be longer than one month.</p>
    <p>For over­time work, salary must be paid within 14 days after the end of a salary pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Act cov­ers lo­cal and for­eign em­ploy­ees ex­cept sea­far­ers, do­mes­tic work­ers, statu­tory board em­ploy­ees and civil ser­vants.</p>
    <p>Ms Ce­leste Ang, a prin­ci­pal at law firm Baker McKen­zie Wong & Leow, says that if Covid-19 fi­nan­cial sup­port is in­suf­fi­cient and an em­ployer is truly fac­ing fi­nan­cial chal­lenges, em­ploy­ees who have not been paid their wages should ac­tively en­gage with their em­ploy­ers and unions (if ap­pli­ca­ble) on pay­ment of out­stand­ing salaries.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) notes that if the business is in dif­fi­culty, the em­ployer should ex­plain and seek its staff’s un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>If wage cuts are needed, the em­ployer should lead by ex­am­ple and ex­plain to em­ploy­ees why wage sac­ri­fices are nec­es­sary in or­der to save jobs. How­ever, em­ploy­ers should not act uni­lat­er­ally and use fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties as an ex­cuse not to pay salaries while ex­pect­ing staff to con­tinue work­ing, says the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who still do not re­ceive their salaries after dis­cussing it with their em­ploy­ers should re­port non-pay­ment of salary to the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment (TADM) as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>You can file a salary-re­lated claim for up to $20,000 per claim, or up to $30,000 per claim if you are a union mem­ber as­sisted by your union.</p>
    <p>The non-re­fund­able reg­is­tra­tion fees are $10 per claim if you are claim­ing up to $10,000, and $20 per claim if you are claim­ing more than $10,000.</p>
    <p>Note that there is a dead­line – if you are still em­ployed by the com­pany, you must file the claim within one year after the dis­pute arose; if you have left the com­pany, file within six months after your last day of em­ploy­ment. You can claim for owed salaries only from up to one year be­fore the date of fil­ing.</p>
    <p>In the light of Covid-19, TADM has shifted its faceto-face me­di­a­tion and ad­vi­sory ser­vices to phone and on­line plat­forms, which help to min­imise the need for in-per­son meet­ings.</p>
    <p>MOM’s spokesman says em­ploy­ees are en­cour­aged to file claims as soon as pos­si­ble, as early re­port­ing pre­vents salary ar­rears from snow­balling and im­proves their chances of re­cov­er­ing them.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nan­cial year that ended on March 31 last year, TADM re­cov­ered some $15 mil­lion in salaries owed to em­ploy­ees here, with about 90 per cent of em­ploy­ees who filed claims fully re­cov­er­ing their salaries.</p>
    <p>If your com­pany is un­der bank­ruptcy, ju­di­cial man­age­ment or liq­ui­da­tion, the claim should not be filed with TADM but in­stead filed di­rectly with the In­sol­vency Of­fice or the ap­pointed ju­di­cial man­ager or liq­uida­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Ang adds that as a mat­ter of last re­sort, em­ploy­ees can seek re­lief be­fore the Em­ploy­ment Claims Tri­bunal or the civil courts de­pend­ing on, among other fac­tors, the quan­tum of the claim.</p>
    <p>The fil­ing fees for the Em­ploy­ment Claims Tri­bunal are be­low $100, but the fil­ing fees in court plus the costs to main­tain the ac­tion in court are much more sub­stan­tial, she says.</p>
    <p>Lodg­ing a com­plaint about your em­ployer should not af­fect your rep­u­ta­tion or hin­der your fu­ture job search, as em­ploy­ees who seek to en­force their right to be paid are act­ing rea­son­ably, says the MOM spokesman.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of prospec­tive em­ploy­ers are dis­cern­ing and will not view a worker who has lodged a claim with TADM neg­a­tively, she adds.</p>
