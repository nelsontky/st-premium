    <p>As the third-gen­er­a­tion owner of elec­tron­ics re­tailer T K Foto, Mr James Ng is no stranger to bring­ing new ideas to the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>But when the Covid-19 pan­demic first reached Sin­ga­pore early this year, he re­alised the pace of change had to be far quicker than he an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways knew that we would have to dig­i­talise no mat­ter what, but the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion pushed for­ward a lot of our plans,” said Mr Ng, 43.</p>
    <p>“If we had not dig­i­talised... the com­pany would have been ob­so­lete now.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which has out­lets in Fu­nan mall and Plaza Sin­ga­pura, re­vamped its web­site dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, and also in­creased the num­ber of prod­ucts put up for sale monthly on e-com­merce plat­forms such as Lazada and Shopee from about 300 to 1,200.</p>
    <p>This en­abled T K Foto to ex­pand its on­line cus­tomer base by three times from April to July.</p>
    <p>On­line sales now make up about 15 per cent of its to­tal rev­enue, com­pared with less than 5 per cent be­fore the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­ceived a $2,500 Dig­i­tal Re­silience Bonus (DRB) pay­out in Au­gust for its ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Go­ing dig­i­tal has also paid off for Mr Ricky Lim, who owns de­sign and gar­den­ing store The Green Cap­sule in Fu­nan mall and is open­ing a sec­ond out­let at</p>
    <p>Great World City next month.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing adopted e-com­merce and in­ven­tory man­age­ment solutions, Mr Lim, 37, now wants to utilise data an­a­lyt­ics, which he be­lieves will help him un­der­stand his cus­tomers’ needs bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“Adopt­ing all these dig­i­tal solutions has re­ally helped us grow our busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And with the DRB and sup­port from the Pro­duc­tiv­ity Solutions Grant, we have man­aged to do this at a very low cost,” he added. Lester Wong</p>
