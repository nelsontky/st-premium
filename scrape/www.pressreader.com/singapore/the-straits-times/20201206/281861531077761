    <p>Ja­panese lead­ers con­tinue to strike an up­beat tone amid earnest prepa­ra­tions for the Tokyo Olympics and Par­a­lympic Games next year, with a flurry of meet­ings in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>But pub­lic scep­ti­cism re­mains high over whether it is even a good idea to pro­ceed as the Covid-19 pan­demic rages on world­wide.</p>
    <p>Not help­ing mat­ters is the fact that Ja­pan’s third wave of in­fec­tions is also its worst by far, and is show­ing lit­tle signs of abat­ing.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal Tokyo logged a new one-day high of 584 cases yes­ter­day, while the num­ber of se­verely ill pa­tients na­tion­wide has soared to new heights.</p>
    <p>Un­der­ly­ing the doom and gloom, how­ever, is a sense of hope that Covid-19 vac­cines will soon be read­ily avail­able, pro­vid­ing a huge boost to the Games.</p>
    <p>Last week, Ja­pan ap­proved free vac­ci­na­tions for its en­tire pop­u­la­tion of 125.8 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, whose pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe once donned a Su­per Mario cos­tume for the sport­ing events, is now lead­ing the push for the Games to go ahead.</p>
    <p>The Olympics are set to be held from July 23 to Aug 8, and the Par­a­lympics from Aug 24 to Sept 5.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga told the United Na­tions Gen­eral As­sem­bly in a video mes­sage on Fri­day that he “will con­tinue to spare no ef­fort” to bring about a Games that will be “safe and se­cure”.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike has, sim­i­larly, said that as the leader of the host city, she is</p>
    <p>“de­ter­mined to achieve the Games, what­ever it takes”.</p>
    <p>Last week, Tokyo 2020 stake­hold­ers met and de­cided on mea­sures such as test­ing ath­letes for Covid-19 “every 96 to 120 hours” in a cen­tre to be set up in the Games Vil­lage. Ath­letes are also to fly back home af­ter their com­pe­ti­tion ends, and keep sight­see­ing and in­ter­ac­tions with or­di­nary Ja­panese to a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion on whether to al­low for­eign spec­ta­tors into the coun­try and, if so, how many, has been de­ferred un­til some time next year, be­fore June.</p>
    <p>But there is a grow­ing sense in some quar­ters that the Games have, in ef­fect, be­come a poi­soned chal­ice.</p>
    <p>The Asahi Shim­bun said in an ed­i­to­rial last month that lead­ers are right to con­tinue pre­par­ing for the Games, but their overzeal­ous­ness is strik­ingly tone-deaf amid the lack of pub­lic en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>“What the lead­ers have for­got­ten about is the need to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion cool-head­edly and adapt flex­i­bly to cir­cum­stances,” the news­pa­per said. “In their rush to­wards a fore­gone con­clu­sion of pro­ceed­ing, they may lose the sup­port of the peo­ple, who are vi­tal to en­sur­ing a suc­cess­ful Olympics and Par­a­lympics.”</p>
    <p>The grow­ing pub­lic scep­ti­cism comes as bank­rupt­cies soar to new highs in Ja­pan. The num­ber of sui­cides in Oc­to­ber ex­ceeded the coun­try’s over­all Covid-19 death toll as at Nov 30.</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter user who goes by the han­dle @Narodovlas­tiye wrote in a widely-shared tweet: “Rather than spend­ing tax­pay­ers’ money on coun­ter­mea­sures for the Olympics, there are way more ef­fec­tive ways to curb the spread of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The user added: “It sim­ply can­not be over­looked that the lives of res­i­dents are be­ing toyed with for the sake of the Olympics, which should be can­celled.”</p>
    <p>But Mr David Ash­ton, a Tokyo-based part­ner at the Brunswick Group con­sul­tancy, wrote in an opin­ion piece for Nikkei Asia that a suc­cess­ful Games could be a bea­con of hope to a world in dis­tress.</p>
    <p>“There will surely be sig­nif­i­cant la­tent de­mand for the in­spi­ra­tional mo­ments” amid the stress, anx­i­ety and eco­nomic hard­ship, he said, even if the Games can­not safely ac­com­mo­date crowds.</p>
    <p>Mr Ash­ton added that pulling the plug on the Games en­tirely “would in­flict fur­ther mis­ery on the world”, not­ing that the event can fos­ter “a sense that there is light at the end of the tun­nel”.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, there are ques­tions over whether this ought to be the Ja­panese tax­pay­ers’ bur­den to bear.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the one-year de­lay, the Games were al­ready the most ex­pen­sive Sum­mer Olympics on record, with a price tag of 1.35 tril­lion yen (S$17.3 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment, along with nec­es­sary Covid-19 mea­sures, will add an­other 294 bil­lion yen to the price tag – com­pris­ing 198 bil­lion yen for ad­di­tional Games-re­lated ex­penses – in­clud­ing venue book­ings, equip­ment ren­tal and wages – and 96 bil­lion yen for Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures.</p>
    <p>It was de­cided on Fri­day that Tokyo tax­pay­ers will foot the largest share of the ad­di­tional ex­pen­di­ture of 120 bil­lion yen – com­pris­ing 80 bil­lion for ad­di­tional costs and 40 bil­lion for Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment will fork out 71 bil­lion yen – com­pris­ing 15 bil­lion for ad­di­tional costs and 56 bil­lion for mea­sures against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The re­main­der of 103 bil­lion yen will be paid by the pri­vately-funded Tokyo 2020 Com­mit­tee, which said in a state­ment on Fri­day that it was con­sid­er­ing “all pos­si­ble op­ti­mi­sa­tion and stream­lin­ing mea­sures aimed at sim­pli­fy­ing the op­er­a­tion of the Games”.</p>
    <p>CAN­CEL THE OLYMPICS</p>
    <p>It sim­ply can­not be over­looked that the lives of res­i­dents are be­ing toyed with for the sake of the Olympics, which should be can­celled.</p>
