    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) Per­for­mance Trial 2 yes­ter­day was the fi­nal event of a virus-hit sea­son for many, and it was also Roy Ng’s last chance to re­write the Un­der-18 boys’ na­tional javelin record.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old made sure to seize his op­por­tu­nity at the Home of Ath­let­ics at Kal­lang, notch­ing a 61.79m throw on his sixth and fi­nal at­tempt to bet­ter the pre­vi­ous mark of 59.76m set by Wang Tingjia at the 2017 Asean School Games.</p>
    <p>The record-break­ing achieve­ment was Roy’s sec­ond in two weeks, af­ter he set a na­tional U-20 mark of 57.19m at the SA Per­for­mance Trial 1 on Nov 29.</p>
    <p>“I just pushed my­self and luck­ily I got it,” said Roy, who was nurs­ing a mi­nor in­jury in his right hand.</p>
    <p>“For some rea­son, be­fore the throw, I man­aged to keep calm. It was only af­ter the throw that all the stress came out.</p>
    <p>“It was a huge re­lief (when I saw it was a good throw), it was a good feel­ing for me.”</p>
    <p>In or­der to com­pete in the U-18 event, he made the switch from the heav­ier 800g javelin used in the</p>
    <p>U-20 com­pe­ti­tion to a 700g spear af­ter last month’s meet.</p>
    <p>His coach Chen Jin­long felt that it might have been the rea­son why it took his charge six tries to break the record.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old said: “When you throw the 800g (javelin), it comes down faster, but for the 700g, if you don’t tilt it prop­erly, it’ll keep fly­ing and it won’t go far.</p>
    <p>“He was still try­ing to catch the javelin in the first five (at­tempts), but he caught it in the last one.”</p>
    <p>Although he was only able to train at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker ear­lier this year, Roy made sure to main­tain his fit­ness by do­ing body weight train­ing and car­dio ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>This was key to a smooth tran­si­tion back to train­ing on the field, he added.</p>
    <p>With two na­tional age group records un­der his belt, the Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion student-ath­lete is aim­ing for an­other mark next year – the Schools A Di­vi­sion boys’ record of 59.06m – be­fore he sits for his A lev­els.</p>
    <p>That record is held by Justyn Phoa, who set the na­tional men’s javelin record of 61.07m at last month’s meet.</p>
    <p>Roy said: “Just break­ing the record al­lows me to sur­prise my­self. It’s a sig­nal to my­self that I can do bet­ter, no mat­ter the cir­cum­stances. It’s the re­as­sur­ance that I got from this com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“At the start of the cir­cuit breaker, there were lots of ques­tion marks, but to come out of it and be­ing able to do all this is a huge sigh of re­lief and a sign to keep push­ing.”</p>
