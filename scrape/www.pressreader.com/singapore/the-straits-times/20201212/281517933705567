    <p>Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in prime lo­ca­tions may re­ceive more sub­si­dies as the Gov­ern­ment con­sid­ers ways to en­sure new Hous­ing Board units re­main af­ford­able for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>But home own­ers may face re­stric­tions on the re­sale con­di­tions for such flats, un­der one idea be­ing con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in prime lo­ca­tions may re­ceive more sub­si­dies as the Gov­ern­ment con­sid­ers ways to en­sure that new Hous­ing Board units re­main af­ford­able for or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>But home own­ers may face re­stric­tions on the re­sale con­di­tions for fu­ture prime area pub­lic hous­ing projects, un­der one idea be­ing con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Desmond Lee said that a new hous­ing model is nec­es­sary for BTO flats in “new ar­eas with very prime at­tributes” be­cause they will be “a lot more ex­pen­sive than cur­rent BTO flats”.</p>
    <p>In or­der to keep fu­ture hous­ing projects in prime lo­ca­tions – such as those in the city cen­tre or the Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front – af­ford­able, Mr Lee said the Gov­ern­ment may have to ap­ply more sub­si­dies, on top of the ex­ist­ing sub­si­dies that are al­ready pro­vided to­day for all BTO flat buy­ers.</p>
    <p>But he ac­knowl­edged that the ad­di­tional sub­si­dies may raise some is­sues.</p>
    <p>“There is the is­sue of fair­ness when th­ese ad­di­tional sub­si­dies add to higher cap­i­tal gains for buy­ers of such flats in prime lo­ca­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, we want to pre­serve the char­ac­ter of pub­lic hous­ing in th­ese es­tates, so that like other HDB es­tates in Sin­ga­pore, they con­tinue to re­main in­clu­sive over time.”</p>
    <p>He also re­it­er­ated that a di­verse range of flat types will be built in up­com­ing es­tates in prime lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing two-room flexi flats and rental hous­ing where pos­si­ble, to cater to dif­fer­ent needs and keep Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic hous­ing di­verse.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said the Gov­ern­ment will con­sider measures for up­com­ing new flats in the prime ar­eas that “bal­ance be­tween th­ese var­i­ous ob­jec­tives”.</p>
    <p>“We have re­ceived many ideas – for ex­am­ple, some have sug­gested in­tro­duc­ing some re­stric­tions on the re­sale con­di­tions for fu­ture prime area projects,” he said.</p>
    <p>Call­ing for more sug­ges­tions from the pub­lic, he said there is a whole range of ideas that can ap­ply to th­ese fu­ture flats un­der the new hous­ing model, which will be stud­ied care­fully by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr Lee said in an in­ter­view with Lianhe Zaobao that a range of hous­ing types will be de­lib­er­ately in­jected into up­com­ing es­tates in prime lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>He also ac­knowl­edged the lot­tery ef­fect of th­ese well-lo­cated flats when they are resold at high prices, re­sult­ing in a likely wind­fall for home own­ers.</p>
    <p>He then said that the pric­ing of flats must be kept af­ford­able at the first sale by HDB, and also in re­sales, hint­ing that a se­ries of measures may be im­ple­mented to en­sure “if re­sale is per­mit­ted for th­ese flats, that they re­main af­ford­able for gen­er­a­tions to come”.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said it was rea­son­able to ex­pect that pub­lic hous­ing projects in prime ar­eas may be sub­jected to dif­fer­ent measures, com­pared with those in the sub­urbs and newer res­i­den­tial es­tates.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance, economics and real es­tate pro­fes­sor Su­mit Agar­wal of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Busi­ness School noted that with the ob­vi­ous ben­e­fits to liv­ing in prime ar­eas, there was a need to ap­ply mech­a­nisms to make it harder for th­ese home own­ers to profit from re­sales.</p>
    <p>“In the first or­der, it is very im­por­tant we have in­te­gra­tion – we don’t want two Sin­ga­pores, with one Sin­ga­pore in the sub­urbs and an­other in the city cen­tre, where rich Sin­ga­pore­ans and for­eign­ers live,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Agar­wal sug­gested a dif­fer­ent tax struc­ture for peo­ple look­ing to sell their flats in prime es­tates be­fore buy­ing an­other prop­erty.</p>
    <p>“They will have to pay an ad­di­tional stamp duty on top of ex­ist­ing stamp du­ties or re­sale levies paid by oth­ers. This will dis­cour­age them from trad­ing their HDB and give them more in­cen­tive to stay in their flats.”</p>
    <p>He also pro­posed, as a fur­ther dis­in­cen­tive to sell­ing, that the min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod (MOP) of five years be ex­tended to seven for th­ese HDB flats.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, OrangeTee & Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, raised the idea of sell­ing th­ese flats with shorter leases pegged to the buyer’s age – which is al­ready a fea­ture of up­com­ing as­sisted-liv­ing flats in Bukit Ba­tok.</p>
    <p>It was an­nounced on Thurs­day that se­niors aged 65 and above would be el­i­gi­ble for th­ese flats, and with a lease rang­ing from 15 to 35 years, as long as it cov­ers the ap­pli­cant and the spouse un­til at least 95 years of age.</p>
    <p>“This helps to en­sure buy­ers are truly buy­ing the flats for their own stay and not for in­vest­ment,” said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>“They need to think care­fully if they want to pur­chase flats with shorter leases when com­pared to new flats in other lo­ca­tions. Shorter leases will also mean that the price of flats will be kept more af­ford­able.”</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING THINGS FAIR</p>
    <p>There is the is­sue of fair­ness when th­ese ad­di­tional sub­si­dies add to higher cap­i­tal gains for buy­ers of such flats in prime lo­ca­tions.</p>
