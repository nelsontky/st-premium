    <p>From lunch in an Air­bus A-380 for $50 per head in the econ­omy cabin, to tours of its train­ing fa­cil­ity near Changi Air­port, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) wants to draw cus­tomers again amid the Covid-19 pan­demic that has made fly­ing im­pos­si­ble for many.</p>
    <p>The A-380 three-hour lunch deal is avail­able across all classes, with prices go­ing up to $600 for those who wish to ex­pe­ri­ence the Suites – touted as an ul­tra-first class prod­uct.</p>
    <p>For those who fancy a behindthe-scenes tour at SIA’s train­ing fa­cil­ity, the cost is $15 for chil­dren be­tween three and 12 years old, and $30 for adults.</p>
    <p>Other op­tions, such as $500 for a flight sim­u­la­tor ex­pe­ri­ence for up to three par­tic­i­pants, can also be added to the tour.</p>
    <p>The air­line is also of­fer­ing a home de­liv­ery ser­vice, with in­struc­tions on how the food should be heated and served. Prices will start from $288 for a busi­ness-class meal for two and $448 for a first-class meal.</p>
    <p>These meals will come with a bot­tle of wine and amenity kits.</p>
    <p>The prices stated ex­clude the 7 per cent goods and ser­vices tax.</p>
    <p>Book­ings will open on Oct 12 for the A-380 lunch and Nov 1 for the train­ing fa­cil­ity tour, the air­line said yes­ter­day. Book­ings for the meal de­liv­ery ser­vice will start on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>SIA will as­sess the de­mand be­fore de­cid­ing whether to launch ad­di­tional pro­grammes, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Mr Aaron Wong, who founded the Mile­lion web­site which tracks how to best make use of flight re­wards, ex­pects the in-flight din­ing and tours to be more pop­u­lar than the home de­liv­ered meals.</p>
    <p>He said: “The tour is a rare chance for the pub­lic to get a first-hand look be­hind the scenes at SIA’s train­ing fa­cil­i­ties, which would be im­pos­si­ble for non-me­dia dur­ing reg­u­lar times.”</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic ac­cel­er­at­ing the re­tire­ment of the A-380 world­wide, there may also be fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties “to ex­pe­ri­ence the largest air­craft in the world”, he said.</p>
    <p>But Mr Wong said it would not be pru­dent for SIA cus­tomers to use their KrisF­lyer miles to pay for the new of­fer­ings – which the air­line is al­low­ing as an op­tion.</p>
    <p>He noted that the miles are worth more when used for ticket re­demp­tion and pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Makan­su­tra founder K. F. See­toh does not think many peo­ple will want to pay $288 or $448 for vac­uum-packed food for two that they have to heat up them­selves, even if de­liv­ered to their homes.</p>
    <p>And while he ac­knowl­edged that SIA en­gages top chefs to de­sign the menus, the meals here are pre­pared by cater­ers and not the chefs them­selves.</p>
    <p>SIA had ear­lier con­sid­ered launch­ing flights to nowhere, but said on Tues­day that it had de­cided not to pro­ceed with the plan.</p>
    <p>This was af­ter tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion fac­tors such as en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pli­ca­tions, and the fi­nan­cial vi­a­bil­ity of such flights.</p>
    <p>Se­nior lec­turer Boey Yew Tung, from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Nanyang Busi­ness School, ex­pects the new ini­tia­tives to be wel­comed by the pub­lic, es­pe­cially those who were con­cerned about the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of flights to nowhere.</p>
    <p>With many in­ter­na­tional bor­ders still closed to leisure travel and re­stric­tions be­ing eased only pro­gres­sively for busi­ness and es­sen­tial travel, the bulk of SIA’s planes have re­mained grounded since March.</p>
    <p>By the end of next month, SIA will op­er­ate at just 11 per cent of its over­all ca­pac­ity com­pared with the lev­els be­fore Covid-19.</p>
