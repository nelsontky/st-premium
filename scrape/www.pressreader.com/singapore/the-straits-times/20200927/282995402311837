    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s labour force has grown sub­stan­tially over the past two decades, from 2.2 mil­lion in 1999 to 3.7 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>This com­prises peo­ple who are em­ployed – also known as be­ing in the work­force – as well as those who are un­em­ployed, that is, not in a job but want to and are able to work.</p>
    <p>It can also be bro­ken down into lo­cal res­i­dents, which re­fer to Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, and for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans make up about 85 per cent of the res­i­dent labour force.</p>
    <p>Here are nine key char­ac­ter­is­tics about the res­i­dent labour force, as seen from sta­tis­tics col­lected by the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>The age pro­file is ris­ing as the pop­u­la­tion ages</p>
    <p>In 1999, 56 per cent of the res­i­dent labour force was aged 15 to 39, while last year, the pro­por­tion was just 40.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>This means the ma­jor­ity are now aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>More older work­ers are re­main­ing in the labour force in­stead of re­tir­ing.</p>
    <p>While the same break­down is not avail­able for data for 1999, the labour force participat­ion rate for res­i­dents aged 65 to 69 rose from 29.9 per cent in 2009 to 46.1 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>For those aged 70 and above, the rate rose from 10.5 per cent in 2009 to 17.6 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>More women are work­ing</p>
    <p>The num­ber of res­i­dent women aged 15 and above who are em­ployed here has risen from 606,200 in 1999 to 1.03 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ment rate for women aged 15 and above rose in tan­dem from 48.1 per cent in 1999 to 58.3 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the rate for men dipped slightly over the same pe­riod, from 74.2 per cent to 72.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the gap be­tween women’s and men’s em­ploy­ment rates has shrunk.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>It’s be­com­ing more com­mon to have higher qual­i­fi­ca­tions</p>
    <p>Last year, more than one in three – 37.5 per cent – res­i­dents aged 15 and above in the labour force were de­gree hold­ers.</p>
    <p>This is more than dou­ble the pro­por­tion (14.6 per cent) who had de­grees back in 1999.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, last year, three in 10 – 31.4 per cent – res­i­dents aged 15 and above in the labour force had post-se­condary qual­i­fi­ca­tions, diplo­mas or pro­fes­sional qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In 1999, just 20.9 per cent had up­per se­condary qual­i­fi­ca­tions, which in­clude diplo­mas and pro­fes­sional qual­i­fi­ca­tions, or poly­tech­nic diplo­mas.</p>
    <p>As work­ers be­came more ed­u­cated, a greater share of them took on pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 58.3 per cent of em­ployed res­i­dents last year were in PMET jobs, up from 42 per cent in 1999. For em­ployed cit­i­zens, the share work­ing in PMET jobs was 55.8 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>As the econ­omy grew, the share of for­eign­ers em­ployed here also grew</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, res­i­dents made up 62.3 per cent of the work­force, down from 71.3 per cent in June 1999. For­eign do­mes­tic work­ers are in­cluded in the to­tal for this cal­cu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The share of res­i­dents in­creased slightly this year to 62.9 per cent in June, amid the Covid-19 cri­sis which has re­sulted in many for­eign work­ers leav­ing Sin­ga­pore af­ter los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, the num­ber of for­eign­ers em­ployed here fell by 5.7 per cent, or 66,400, in the first half of the year, sharper than the fall of 2.7 per cent, or 62,700, of res­i­dent work­ers.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>In­comes have risen over the last two decades</p>
    <p>The me­dian gross monthly in­come for res­i­dents in full-time work has more than dou­bled, from $1,950 in 1999 to $4,000 last year.</p>
    <p>The in­crease was greater among women, for whom me­dian in­come rose 123 per cent over that pe­riod to $3,772 last year.</p>
    <p>Men saw a smaller in­crease of 111 per cent but still had a higher me­dian in­come last year of $4,229.</p>
    <p>The data is for peo­ple aged 15 and above be­sides full-time na­tional ser­vice­men, and ex­cludes em­ployer con­tri­bu­tions to work­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Another thing to note is that in 1999, full-time em­ploy­ment re­ferred to nor­mal work­ing hours of at least 30 hours per week, while from 2009 on­wards, it refers to nor­mal work­ing hours of at least 35 hours per week.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have also seen in­comes grow over the years.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen-spe­cific data re­leased ear­lier this year in­cludes em­ployer CPF con­tri­bu­tions, and shows that the me­dian gross monthly in­come from work for Sin­ga­pore­ans in full-time work was $4,333 last year, slightly lower than the me­dian for res­i­dents of $4,563.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>The ser­vice sec­tor em­ploys the lion’s share of all work­ers here</p>
    <p>Within ser­vices, com­mu­nity, so­cial and per­sonal ser­vices – which in­cludes pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion and ed­u­ca­tion – is the largest sec­tor by em­ploy­ment, fol­lowed by whole­sale and re­tail trade.</p>
    <p>This was the same in 1999 and last year.</p>
    <p>As of June this year, a to­tal of 74.3 per cent of peo­ple here were em­ployed in ser­vice sec­tor jobs.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tion rates are higher</p>
    <p>The rates are 37 per cent up to the age of 55, with em­ploy­ers con­tribut­ing 17 per cent and em­ploy­ees, 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>To­tal con­tri­bu­tion rate ta­pers down to 12.5 per cent for peo­ple above 65.</p>
    <p>In 1999, CPF con­tri­bu­tion rates had been slashed fol­low­ing the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The to­tal rate was 30 per cent up to the age of 55, with em­ploy­ers con­tribut­ing 10 per cent and em­ploy­ees 20 per cent. The to­tal rate ta­pered down to 7 per cent for peo­ple aged above 65.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>Union mem­ber­ship has more than dou­bled in last two decades</p>
    <p>There were 76 em­ploy­ees’ trade unions in 1999, with 289,707 mem­bers. Last year, there were 63 unions, with 785,643 mem­bers. They com­prise unions af­fil­i­ated to the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and those that are not.</p>
    <p>NTUC’s lat­est fig­ure this year states that it has 950,000 mem­bers, which in­cludes other forms of mem­ber­ships be­sides those with unions, such as with its Free­lancers and Self-Em­ployed Unit, Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion – whose mem­bers are not em­ploy­ees – and youth club nEbO.</p>
    <p>9</p>
    <p>Work­place safety has im­proved</p>
    <p>The work-re­lated fa­tal­ity rate fell from 6.5 per 100,000 work­ers in 1999, to 1.1 per 100,000 work­ers last year. The cur­rent tar­get is to re­duce and sus­tain Sin­ga­pore’s work­place fa­tal­ity rate at less than one per 100,000 work­ers by 2028.</p>
