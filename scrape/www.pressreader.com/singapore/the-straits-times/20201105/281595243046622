    <p>Mr Karl Liew, son of the for­mer Changi Air­port Group (CAG) chair­man, will be charged to­day with fur­nish­ing false in­for­ma­tion and giv­ing false ev­i­dence in court, the po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers had di­rected the po­lice to con­duct fur­ther investigat­ions on Mr Liew, in the light of com­ments a High Court judge made on Sept 4 when over­turn­ing the con­vic­tion of the Liew fam­ily’s for­mer maid Parti Liyani for theft.</p>
    <p>The judge had de­scribed him as dis­hon­est in giv­ing ev­i­dence against Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam, in his min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment, said Mr Karl Liew had made sev­eral al­le­ga­tions in the trial that the judge had found sus­pect, in­clud­ing his claim to have worn women’s T-shirts.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said there were many as­pects of Mr Liew’s con­duct and ev­i­dence dur­ing the trial which were “highly un­sat­is­fac­tory”, and raised “scep­ti­cism”.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at the ev­i­dence, the im­pres­sion one gets is that there seems to have been a cav­a­lier at­ti­tude on the part of the Liews, in the way that some items were iden­ti­fied as be­long­ing to them and in the way val­ues were as­cribed to some items,” Mr Shan­mugam told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He added: “When you claim an item, you make sure it is yours. When you as­cribe a value, make sure you have a ba­sis. Ques­tions do arise, about how one or more of the Liews have con­ducted them­selves on these and other as­pects.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam fur­ther high­lighted sev­eral points in Mr Karl Liew’s tes­ti­mony that the High Court found sus­pect.</p>
    <p>• Mr Liew had tes­ti­fied that a Gucci wal­let, a Braun Buf­fel wal­let and a Helix watch – which were found in Ms Parti’s pos­ses­sions – had been given to him by fam­ily mem­bers. Yet none of his fam­ily mem­bers, in­clud­ing his fa­ther Liew Mun Leong, the for­mer CAG chair­man, could re­call hav­ing or giv­ing him these spe­cific items.</p>
    <p>• He said he had bought a bed­sheet, also found in Ms Parti’s pos­ses­sion, from Habi­tat in the United King­dom, even though the bed­sheet had the same pat­tern as a quilt cover with an “Ikea” la­bel. This was also con­tra­dicted by his wife, who said she had never seen the bed­sheet in her room, or on her bed.</p>
    <p>• Mr Liew also could not clearly iden­tify some pieces of cloth­ing, in­clud­ing a black dress, which he claimed was his.</p>
    <p>• He claimed as well the own­er­ship of a pink knife, which he said he had bought be­fore 2002. Mr Liew later con­ceded at the trial that the knife was likely man­u­fac­tured after that date.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said Mr Liew has since been ques­tioned on the in­con­sis­tent state­ments, and has given state­ments on whether the items high­lighted by the High Court had been in his pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added that when fil­ing a po­lice re­port, a com­plainant needs to be se­ri­ous when mak­ing claims about items in ques­tion.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t have to be a com­pre­hen­sive ac­count, but it must be done with care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
