    <p>I re­cently at­tempted to claim a cash voucher via a ma­jor lo­cal bank’s re­demp­tion web­site.</p>
    <p>I found that the web­site had been re­designed, and de­spite por­ing over the var­i­ous menus, I was un­able to lo­cate the in­tended ser­vice.</p>
    <p>I pro­ceeded to call the bank’s concierge ser­vice, and found my­self nav­i­gat­ing labyrinthi­ne au­to­mated menus with in­scrutable op­tions in an ef­fort to reach a cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cer, fur­ther com­pli­cated by a confusing one-time pass­word sys­tem.</p>
    <p>When I was fi­nally able to get hold of a hu­man on the line, they in­formed me that the rel­e­vant bank of­fi­cer was un­avail­able and would call me back later. De­spite wait­ing the rest of the work­ing day, I re­ceived no re­turn call.</p>
    <p>As a client of this bank since the 1960s, I had never be­fore en­coun­tered such ex­treme ob­sta­cles for so mun­dane a pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>In their at­tempts to make re­mote trans­ac­tions more se­cure, and cut costs through au­to­ma­tion, banks have seem­ingly ne­glected cus­tomer needs and sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­though I con­sider my­self rea­son­ably tech lit­er­ate for an oc­to­ge­nar­ian, I found the user in­ter­face of the bank’s web­site in­com­pre­hen­si­ble. One can only imag­ine what the ex­pe­ri­ence might be like for se­nior cit­i­zens less ac­quainted with com­put­ers and smart­phones.</p>
    <p>The frus­trat­ing ex­pe­ri­ence on the bank’s hot­line was also a far cry from the fuss-free phone bank­ing of yes­ter­year.</p>
    <p>I urge the con­sumer bank­ing sec­tor to do bet­ter for the more than 800,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans over the age of 65 who would rather not wres­tle with poorly de­signed au­toma­tons.</p>
