    <p>Of all the events ex­pected this year, the in­com­ing Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s shape and con­duct in the US are guar­an­teed to be of the ut­most im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>This is partly be­cause out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has proved to be such a break from US for­eign and se­cu­rity poli­cies of the past 75 years that any “re­turn to nor­mal­ity and pre­dictabil­ity” of the kind Mr Bi­den is promis­ing is bound to en­tail some rad­i­cal about-turns.</p>
    <p>But it is also be­cause the challenges fac­ing the United States are more press­ing than ever.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply put, Mr Bi­den and his top of­fi­cials would ei­ther suc­ceed in de­rail­ing Iran’s and North Korea’s quests to ac­quire nu­clear weapons or, if they fail, will have to de­cide if they should seek to deny these coun­tries’ nu­clear sta­tus by force, or whether Wash­ing­ton should ac­com­mo­date it­self to a nu­clear Iran and North Korea for decades to come, with all the im­pli­ca­tions that will have for other atomic arms races in north­ern Asia or the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will also have to re­pair Amer­ica’s badly frayed ties with Europe, while at the same time en­gag­ing with Rus­sia, if only to save a re­la­tion­ship which is now in tat­ters and which has al­ready re­sulted in the col­lapse of the en­tire arms con­trol regime.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s tough­est test re­mains that of re­cal­i­brat­ing Amer­ica’s poli­cies to­wards China.</p>
    <p>The new US pres­i­dent will need to em­brace imag­i­na­tive ap­proaches to trade and con­sider stricter guide­lines on se­cu­rity is­sues. He will also have to be ac­com­mo­dat­ing enough to en­gage with the Chi­nese lead­er­ship, but not too ac­com­mo­dat­ing to en­cour­age ei­ther Bei­jing or Amer­ica’s al­lies into be­liev­ing the new White House is a pushover.</p>
    <p>All these are tasks to be ac­com­plished over the four-year du­ra­tion of the Bi­den pres­i­dency. Still, what the new ad­min­is­tra­tion does this year will al­most cer­tainly set the tone for every­thing which fol­lows.</p>
    <p>We will know in the next few days – and well be­fore the new ad­min­is­tra­tion is even sworn in on Jan 20 – whether the two elec­tions in the state of Ge­or­gia can de­liver for Mr Bi­den’s Democrats con­trol of the US Se­nate, which will make the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion’s gov­ern­ing job more man­age­able.</p>
    <p>We will also know in the next few months whether the ad­min­is­tra­tion will fo­cus mainly on its do­mes­tic prob­lems be­cause of the sever­ity of the Covid-19 pan­demic and the re­sult­ing eco­nomic dip, or whether the White House will have enough “band­width” to deal with its mas­sive in­ter­na­tional challenges that re­quire Mr Bi­den’s per­sonal in­put.</p>
    <p>A sub­stan­tial part of the job of re­as­sur­ing al­lies about Amer­ica’s fu­ture course will re­quire his pres­ence, ei­ther in at­tend­ing in­ter­na­tional sum­mits or in ac­com­mo­dat­ing the stream of for­eign lead­ers wait­ing to be in­vited to Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The pace of work in an Oval Of­fice oc­cu­pied by the old­est per­son ever to be elected as US pres­i­dent will be one of the big­gest ques­tions of this year.</p>
    <p>We al­ready know Mr Bi­den, 78, is keen not to be re­garded as ei­ther a restora­tion or con­tin­u­a­tion of the Barack Obama pres­i­dency; that is why many of the top of­fi­cials he has cho­sen held only ju­nior po­si­tions un­der Mr Obama, while many of Mr Obama’s for­mer “stars” were ei­ther ig­nored or shunted to un­ex­pected ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>As is al­ways the case with an in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion, we will dis­cover only in the next few months who are the real in­flu­en­tial play­ers among the new ap­pointees. Will Ms Ka­mala Har­ris, as vice-pres­i­dent, get to play a more sig­nif­i­cant in­ter­na­tional role to lighten the pres­i­dent’s work pres­sures, or will she re­main con­fined to at­tend cer­e­monies in for­eign coun­tries which are too ir­rel­e­vant for the pres­i­dent him­self to at­tend?</p>
    <p>What is the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Mr Antony Blinken, the in­com­ing sec­re­tary of state, and Mr Jake Sul­li­van, the am­bi­tious and rapidly pro­moted na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser to Mr Bi­den?</p>
    <p>And is it likely that for­mer sec­re­tary of state John Kerry will be con­tent with just han­dling the climate change dossier with­out em­broil­ing him­self in skir­mishes with the State Depart­ment or the White House?</p>
    <p>If there is one les­son that en­dures from the Trump pres­i­dency, it is about the im­por­tance of in­di­vid­u­als in the US sys­tem.</p>
    <p>EUROPE, AN IN­TER­NA­TIONAL AC­TOR</p>
    <p>With Bri­tain now firmly out­side the Euro­pean Union, the bloc is keen to show that it can be an in­ter­na­tional ac­tor. Al­though re­lieved to see the back of Pres­i­dent Trump, the Euro­peans are also wary of the de­mands the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion may put on them, es­pe­cially when it comes to pol­icy co­or­di­na­tion to­wards China.</p>
    <p>There­fore, the Euro­peans rushed to con­clude a new in­vest­ment treaty with Bei­jing; the ges­ture serves as a re­minder to Wash­ing­ton that, while Europe has much more in com­mon with the US than with the ris­ing su­per­power in the East, the Euro­peans are de­ter­mined to main­tain their dis­tance from a loom­ing US-China show­down.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic deeply shook the EU, yet it has emerged strength­ened from this cri­sis since it was forced to make de­ci­sions it could not reach be­fore.</p>
    <p>The es­tab­lish­ment of a Recovery Fund with huge sums raised from the fi­nan­cial mar­kets on be­half of all mem­ber coun­tries is an es­sen­tial step to­wards the strength­en­ing and sur­vival of the EU and each of its mem­ber coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The new lead­er­ship of the EU’s top in­sti­tu­tions (Com­mis­sion, Coun­cil and Cen­tral Bank) proved that the bloc could chart a new course.</p>
    <p>Yet all this ul­ti­mately de­pends on the lead­er­ship of the larger coun­tries, es­pe­cially Ger­many and France, and this year will bring changes for both.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel will re­tire, and the fight for her suc­ces­sion will soon reach its cli­max. There are two lead­ing con­tenders.</p>
    <p>The first is Mr Ar­min Laschet, a mod­er­ate Merkel ally and the rul­ing party lead­er­ship’s favourite. He is also the leader of Ger­many’s largest state, NorthRhine West­phalia, and is seen very much as the con­ti­nu­ity can­di­date.</p>
    <p>But then, there is Mr Friedrich Merz, a con­ser­va­tive Merkel critic at­tempt­ing a po­lit­i­cal come­back af­ter 15 en­rich­ing years in the pri­vate sec­tor. He will pull the govern­ment much more to the right.</p>
    <p>Who­ever takes over from Dr Merkel will have to run a coali­tion govern­ment af­ter Ger­many’s Septem­ber elec­tions, which are bound to con­firm a rise in the power of smaller par­ties, at the ex­pense of the big par­ties which have dom­i­nated Ger­man politics for decades.</p>
    <p>By the end of this year, the chances are high that Ger­many will be led by a new and untested chan­cel­lor of the cen­tre-right, head­ing a new and untested coali­tion which tends to veer to the cen­tre-left.</p>
    <p>And al­though French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron does not have to face his vot­ers un­til early 2022, this year will be de­ci­sive in pre­par­ing his re-elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Most of Mr Macron’s cur­rent ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing his de­ter­mi­na­tion to reg­u­late the or­gan­i­sa­tion of Mus­lim mi­nori­ties in France and tighten anti-im­mi­gra­tion mea­sures, are de­signed to ad­dress the big­gest chal­lenge fac­ing him, which comes from the na­tion­al­ist far-right.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron is a for­mi­da­ble elec­toral cam­paigner but the last time a French pres­i­dent won re­elec­tion for a se­cond term in of­fice was back in 1995.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin does not need to face re­elec­tion un­til the mid­dle of the decade. Still, Rus­sia’s par­lia­men­tary elec­tions due on Sept 19 will present him with a few prob­lems.</p>
    <p>His party is deeply un­pop­u­lar, and Rus­sia has just ad­mit­ted that its num­ber of deaths from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was far higher than Moscow had ini­tially claimed.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin des­per­ately wants the elec­tions to be con­ducted ap­pro­pri­ately, but he also fears a re­turn of the mass demon­stra­tions which hit Rus­sia a decade ago. So much of the leg­is­la­tion cur­rently in­tro­duced in Rus­sia is de­signed to sti­fle dis­sent.</p>
    <p>There­fore, this year will see a Euro­pean con­ti­nent that is out­wardly more con­fi­dent, along­side an in­ward po­lit­i­cal ex­is­tence which re­mains far more pre­car­i­ous.</p>
    <p>And, as al­ways, all we can fore­see at this stage are the “known un­knowns”; the gen­uine sur­prises are yet to come.</p>
    <p>A sub­stan­tial part of the job of re­as­sur­ing al­lies about Amer­ica’s fu­ture course will re­quire Mr Joe Bi­den’s pres­ence, ei­ther in at­tend­ing in­ter­na­tional sum­mits or in ac­com­mo­dat­ing the stream of for­eign lead­ers wait­ing to be in­vited to Wash­ing­ton. The pace of work in an Oval Of­fice oc­cu­pied by the old­est per­son ever to be elected as US pres­i­dent will be one of the big­gest ques­tions of this year.</p>
