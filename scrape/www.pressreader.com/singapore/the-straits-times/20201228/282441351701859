    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Bradley Beal has erupted for 70 points and block­buster sum­mer ac­qui­si­tion Rus­sell West­brook has recorded a triple­dou­ble in back-to-back Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) games for the Wash­ing­ton Wizards.</p>
    <p>But the strong individual per­for­mances have yet to trans­late into wins in the open­ing games of the league sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Wizards are aim­ing to seal a play-off berth for the first time since 2017-18 but fol­low­ing suc­ces­sive l osses to the Philadel­phia 76ers and the Or­lando Magic – both of whom reached the post-sea­son in Au­gust – there is still con­sid­er­able room for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>Beal fol­lowed up his 39-point dis­play against the Six­ers with 31 points as Wash­ing­ton fell 130-120 at home to the Magic on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, Or­lando swept the Wizards, scor­ing at least 120 points en route to win­ning all four Eastern Con­fer­ence reg­u­lar-sea­son games.</p>
    <p>The Wizards’ de­fence still looks too open and their free-throw woes has car­ried over into the new term.</p>
    <p>They made 16 of 23 shots from the line in a 113-107 set­back against the 76ers and 15 of 28 in the loss to the Magic.</p>
    <p>At 24.6, the hosts were sev­enth in NBA last sea­son in free-throw at­tempts per game but that num­ber was largely in­flated by Beal, who had 8.0 at­tempts per game.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing his team­mates to step up their game, the All-Star guard told The Ath­letic: “We just gotta take those ad­verse times and learn how to deal with them and move on... We have a will­ing team who wants to learn, who wants to get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>West­brook col­lected 15 points, 15 re­bounds and 12 as­sists to join Magic John­son (twice), Jerry Lucas and Os­car Robert­son as the only play­ers in NBA his­tory to record a triple-dou­ble in each of his team’s first two games of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>He is also the first player to do it with a new team af­ter be­ing ac­quired from the Hous­ton Rock­ets in the off-sea­son for fel­low All-Star guard John Wall. How­ever, it was still a patchy game from West­brook, who shot six-of-19 from the field and missed all four of his three-point at­tempts on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“This one’s on me. I was b***s******* around, miss­ing shots,” the 2016-17 Most Valu­able Player said. “For us, we didn’t put our­selves in po­si­tion to win the game, es­pe­cially my­self. Miss­ing easy shots – it wasn’t noth­ing that they did.”</p>
    <p>While Wash­ing­ton are off to a slug­gish start, Or­lando have won their first two games for the first time since 2012-13 and the speed of their game suits Markelle Fultz, who had 21 points on the night.</p>
    <p>“I love it,” the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft told Fox Sports. “It started in train­ing camp. I think it’s going to be good for ev­ery­body.”</p>
