    <p>Sec­tion 424 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code im­poses a le­gal duty on any per­son who is aware that another has com­mit­ted a wide range of of­fences to “im­me­di­ately” re­port the mat­ter to the po­lice, “in the ab­sence of rea­son­able ex­cuse” not to do so. Fail­ure to com­ply with the law is pun­ish­able with im­pris­on­ment of up to six months, and/or a fine.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore ad­mit­ted that it was in a dilemma in de­cid­ing whether to com­ply with this law and even­tu­ally de­cided to make a po­lice re­port against its for­mer lec­turer for sex­ual mis­con­duct, even though both com­plainants re­fused to do so them­selves (Po­lice re­port de­layed out of con­cern for vic­tims: NUS,</p>
    <p>Oct 24). How­ever, it did so more than a month af­ter the first com­plaint sur­faced.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search, not­ing that many or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als do not abide by this law, has also said that its sex­ual as­sault care cen­tre will make a po­lice re­port only in ex­cep­tional cases, such as when the vic­tim is in im­mi­nent dan­ger or is a mi­nor.</p>
    <p>The present law is ob­vi­ously in­con­sis­tent with the aim of coun­sel­lors to help vic­tims to­wards re­cov­ery and the coun­sel­lors’ eth­i­cal duty to main­tain con­fi­den­tial­ity of in­for­ma­tion given to them.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should clar­ify the scope of the le­gal duty. What will be a “rea­son­able ex­cuse” to jus­tify not mak­ing a po­lice re­port?</p>
    <p>How much weight should be given to the vic­tim’s choice, the coun­sel­lor’s as­sess­ment of whether a po­lice re­port will be in the in­ter­ests of the vic­tim, and pos­si­ble dan­ger to fu­ture vic­tims?</p>
    <p>Are the of­fences within the scope of this law too broad? If the al­le­ga­tions turn out to be false, will the coun­sel­lor or or­gan­i­sa­tion be sub­ject to civil or crim­i­nal li­a­bil­ity?</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that there is no time limit in terms of when the of­fences had taken place. For ex­am­ple, an 18-year-old vic­tim may re­veal to a coun­sel­lor that a sex­ual of­fence hap­pened to her when she was 12. Is the coun­sel­lor still un­der an obli­ga­tion to make the po­lice re­port even though there is no dan­ger of the of­fence re­cur­ring?</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should con­sider amend­ing the le­gal pro­vi­sion. If it is de­ter­mined that the le­gal duty is still re­quired for cer­tain se­ri­ous of­fences, then there should be an ex­cep­tion ex­pressly made for those in the help­ing pro­fes­sions so that they can prop­erly tend to those in need.</p>
