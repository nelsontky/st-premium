    <p>Over the last 30 years, China and In­dia have been among the world’s fastest grow­ing economies. In terms of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, their achieve­ments have been spec­tac­u­lar. Be­tween them, they have lifted around one bil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, with China ac­count­ing for about three-quar­ters of the to­tal.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while 30 years ago the two economies were com­pa­ra­ble in many re­spects, this is no longer the case. China’s per­for­mance has sur­passed that of In­dia on al­most ev­ery so­cial and eco­nomic met­ric.</p>
    <p>At US$14.1 tril­lion</p>
    <p>(S$18.8 tril­lion) last year, China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) – the sec­ond largest in the world – is al­most five times that of In­dia. China is also far more in­te­grated into the global econ­omy. It is the world’s largest ex­porter, ac­count­ing for 12.8 per cent of global ex­ports, com­pared with</p>
    <p>1.7 per cent for In­dia.</p>
    <p>China has su­pe­rior phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and a more busi­ness-friendly en­vi­ron­ment. It is also well ahead in terms of so­cial in­di­ca­tors. On the United Na­tions Devel­op­ment Pro­gramme’s 2019 Hu­man Devel­op­ment In­dex, which com­bines mea­sure­ments of life ex­pectancy, years of school­ing and per capita in­come on a pur­chas­ing power par­ity ba­sis, China was ranked 85th out of 189 coun­tries, while In­dia ranked 129th.</p>
    <p>NA­TURE OF RE­FORMS</p>
    <p>What ex­plains China’s out­per­for­mance vis-a-vis In­dia? The di­ver­gence be­tween the two has oc­curred in less than a gen­er­a­tion. As re­cently as 1980, the per capita in­comes of both coun­tries were roughly equal at about US$250. How­ever, China’s su­pe­rior growth com­pounded over the pe­riod has made the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>There are many in­ter­pre­ta­tions of why China grew faster than In­dia. A big part of the story is that China em­barked on its mar­ket-ori­ented eco­nomic re­forms in 1978, more than a decade ahead of In­dia, which, faced with a fi­nan­cial cri­sis, was forced into lib­er­al­is­ing its econ­omy only in 1991.</p>
    <p>The na­ture of China’s re­forms was also dif­fer­ent. It started with agri­cul­tural re­forms, which gave its farm­ers more con­trol over their hold­ings and bet­ter prices. This raised the liv­ing stan­dards of the ma­jor­ity of China’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>At the same time, China en­cour­aged labour-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries such as cloth­ing, toys and light en­gi­neer­ing goods, ar­eas in which its cheap labour en­abled it to quickly be­come com­pet­i­tive, aided by sub­stan­tial for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, ini­tially from Hong Kong and Tai­wan, which poured into newly cre­ated spe­cial eco­nomic zones. As more workers moved to cities, China’s ur­ban­i­sa­tion ac­cel­er­ated, cre­at­ing “ag­glom­er­a­tion ef­fects” – syn­er­gies re­sult­ing from mul­ti­ple eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in close prox­im­ity.</p>
    <p>China’s ur­ban­i­sa­tion rate in­creased dra­mat­i­cally, from</p>
    <p>18 per cent in 1978 to 59 per cent in 2018 (com­pared with 34 per cent in In­dia at present). China’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor ex­panded in both size and so­phis­ti­ca­tion after it joined the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 2001, and es­tab­lished it­self as the big­gest player in global sup­ply chains for many man­u­fac­tured goods, which led to fur­ther job cre­ation as well as tech­nol­ogy trans­fers as global com­pa­nies es­tab­lished pro­duc­tion op­er­a­tions in China.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s 1991 re­forms dis­man­tled some el­e­ments of the “Li­cence Raj” – a panoply of bu­reau­cratic ob­sta­cles to busi­ness – and par­tially lib­er­alised im­ports and for­eign in­vest­ment. While these were sig­nif­i­cant re­forms that also spurred higher rates of in­vest­ment, in­clud­ing for­eign in­vest­ment, they largely by­passed the farm sec­tor, where the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion lives, and thus did not lead to mass job cre­ation as in China.</p>
    <p>The ser­vices sec­tor ex­panded and is now the largest in the econ­omy. Many man­u­fac­tur­ing ac­tiv­i­ties were re­served for the small-scale sec­tor and these were thus un­able to scale up.</p>
    <p>In­dia failed to ad­dress the big­gest con­straints to the ex­pan­sion of man­u­fac­tur­ing, no­tably rigid labour laws and prob­lems with land ac­qui­si­tion, which per­sist to this day and have de­terred both In­dian and for­eign com­pa­nies from in­vest­ing in mass man­u­fac­tur­ing, de­spite a ma­jor “Make in In­dia” ini­tia­tive launched by the gov­ern­ment in 2014. In­dia’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in global man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­ply chains, which have ex­panded since the 1990s, was, there­fore, limited.</p>
    <p>In short, after an im­pres­sive ini­tial burst in the early 1990s, In­dia did not per­sist with its re­forms. Only much later, in the last five years, did it push through im­por­tant re­forms such as the in­tro­duc­tion of a bio­met­ric na­tional iden­ti­fi­ca­tion sys­tem, a na­tional goods and ser­vices tax and a bank­ruptcy code.</p>
    <p>TWO MYTHS</p>
    <p>China, by con­trast, main­tained a con­tin­u­ous process of re­form, which in­cluded in­sti­tu­tional re­forms such as al­low­ing pri­vate, for­eign and col­lec­tive-own­er­ship com­pa­nies to op­er­ate, pri­vatis­ing state-owned en­ter­prises, strength­en­ing prop­erty rights and, more re­cently, ex­pand­ing the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Be­gin­ning in the 1990s, China started to ramp up its in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing and now has the world’s largest net­work of high-speed rail and ex­press­ways, which In­dia is in the rel­a­tively early stages of build­ing.</p>
    <p>Here, it is im­por­tant to cor­rect the pop­u­lar myth that In­dia’s in­fra­struc­ture deficit vis-a-vis China is a ma­jor cause of its rel­a­tive un­der­per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>As Pro­fes­sor Yasheng Huang of the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy Sloan School of Man­age­ment has pointed out, up to the 1990s, China had poor in­fra­struc­ture but still grew rapidly. China built its in­fra­struc­ture after – not be­fore – more than a decade of high growth.</p>
    <p>“The ‘China mir­a­cle’ hap­pened not be­cause it had glit­ter­ing sky­scrapers and mod­ern high­ways, but be­cause bold eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion and in­sti­tu­tional re­forms... cre­ated com­pe­ti­tion and nur­tured pri­vate en­trepreneur­ship,” he said. In­fra­struc­ture may have helped to sus­tain China’s rapid growth, but did not cause it.</p>
    <p>Nor, to cor­rect an­other myth, is China’s su­pe­rior in­fra­struc­ture the re­sult of its one-party sys­tem – other coun­tries have man­aged to build good in­fra­struc­ture with­out such a sys­tem. It is the re­sult of many years of rapid growth and sus­tained re­forms which gen­er­ated fi­nan­cial re­sources.</p>
    <p>How­ever, China’s sys­tem of gov­ern­ment has led to a state that is, in many ways, more ef­fec­tive than that of In­dia. This has long been true: China has had a stronger state than In­dia through­out much of its his­tory and has been bet­ter able to mo­bilise so­ci­ety for state aims.</p>
    <p>Its state has also been more in­no­va­tive, en­gag­ing in ex­per­i­men­ta­tion and pilot­ing, for ex­am­ple, in the cre­ation of spe­cial eco­nomic zones. The dif­fer­ences in state ca­pac­ity be­tween the two coun­tries are a ma­jor de­ter­mi­nant of the dif­fer­ences in eco­nomic per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>In­dia is widely viewed as hav­ing an over­bear­ing state. While in­deed In­dia’s bu­reau­cracy has been in­tru­sive and ob­struc­tive, es­pe­cially in the eco­nomic realm, po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tists point out that, far from be­ing ex­ces­sively large, In­dia’s state is among the small­est in the world rel­a­tive to its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to In­dia’s 7th Pay Com­mis­sion, the coun­try had just 16 gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees per 1,000 pop­u­la­tion in 2015 (the lat­est year for which data is avail­able), com­pared with 51 in China. In­dia’s pub­lic sec­tor em­ploy­ment has been de­clin­ing since 1991 even as the pop­u­la­tion has in­creased, and there are sig­nif­i­cant va­can­cies in even es­sen­tial pub­lic ser­vices such as the po­lice and the ju­di­ciary.</p>
    <p>While In­dia’s state has been ex­tremely ef­fec­tive in ma­jor un­der­tak­ings such as or­gan­is­ing elec­tions for 850 mil­lion vot­ers, re­spond­ing to nat­u­ral calami­ties and man­ag­ing a large space pro­gramme, it has not been able to de­liver on core func­tions such as pro­vid­ing ba­sic pub­lic goods, which im­pact peo­ple’s daily lives.</p>
    <p>HEALTH­CARE AND ED­U­CA­TION</p>
    <p>Two ar­eas in which the gaps be­tween China and In­dia are es­pe­cially glar­ing are health­care and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>China has long had an ex­ten­sive na­tional net­work of health­care ser­vices, start­ing with bare­foot doc­tors and com­mune clin­ics in the 1950s. It has also em­pha­sised pub­lic health mea­sures. In­dia has done noth­ing com­pa­ra­ble.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore China’s re­forms in 1978, its life ex­pectancy was 68 years, while In­dia’s was 54 years. While the gap in this par­tic­u­lar met­ric has nar­rowed (China’s life ex­pectancy is now 76 years while In­dia’s is 68 years), there re­main sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences in nu­tri­tional and other health-re­lated in­di­ca­tors, which means that China has long had the ben­e­fit of a health­ier and more pro­duc­tive work­force. The dif­fer­ences in the em­pha­sis on health­care per­sist to this day. Cur­rently, China spends more than 6 per cent of its GDP on health­care, while In­dia spends 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>China has also con­sis­tently in­vested more in ed­u­ca­tion, re­sult­ing in a higher lit­er­acy rate – par­tic­u­larly of women – and higher school and col­lege en­rol­ments, as well as more spend­ing on re­search and devel­op­ment. While In­dia is catch­ing up – and there are big dif­fer­ences in ed­u­ca­tional at­tain­ments among its states – decades of lag­ging be­hind China in ed­u­ca­tion have left In­dia’s work­force and tech­no­log­i­cal devel­op­ment at a sig­nif­i­cant dis­ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Many econ­o­mists, in­clud­ing In­dian No­bel lau­re­ate Amartya Sen, point out that the gaps be­tween the two coun­tries in the crit­i­cal ar­eas of health­care and ed­u­ca­tion are the most im­por­tant de­ter­mi­nants of the dif­fer­ences in their eco­nomic per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>While that is the story so far, it could change in the fu­ture. At least as far as eco­nomic growth is con­cerned, In­dia, with its younger pop­u­la­tion, has a de­mo­graphic ad­van­tage. Its less ma­ture econ­omy could also mean po­ten­tially higher growth than China over the medium term, pro­vided it man­ages its econ­omy as­tutely and im­proves its state ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>China will also face new chal­lenges. Be­sides deal­ing with an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, as a mid­dle-in­come coun­try, it will have to con­tend with dif­fi­cult re­forms, es­pe­cially in the con­text of a one-party state, in­clud­ing in­sti­tut­ing the rule of law as well as bet­ter reg­u­lat­ing its cap­i­tal mar­kets and im­prov­ing its cor­po­rate gov­er­nance, ar­eas in which In­dia is ahead.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cally, while In­dia’s democ­racy is well en­trenched, some ob­servers be­lieve that China may face an un­cer­tain po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion. Geopo­lit­i­cal is­sues, in­clud­ing re­la­tions with the United States, could also im­pact the fu­ture of both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>There­fore, much re­mains to be played out. How­ever, for now, as their economies go, China and In­dia are at dif­fer­ent stages of devel­op­ment.</p>

    <p>This ar­ti­cle is from In­dia On Our Minds, a col­lec­tion of 50 es­says by Sin­ga­pore­ans on In­dia. Edited by Am­bas­sador-at-large Tommy Koh and the In­sti­tute of South Asian Stud­ies’ se­nior as­so­ciate direc­tor Her­naikh Singh, the book was launched this week.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore China’s re­forms in 1978, its life ex­pectancy was 68 years, while In­dia’s was 54 years. While the gap in this par­tic­u­lar met­ric has nar­rowed (China’s life ex­pectancy is now 76 years while In­dia’s is 68 years), there re­main sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences in nu­tri­tional and other health-re­lated in­di­ca­tors, which means that China has long had the ben­e­fit of a health­ier and more pro­duc­tive work­force. The dif­fer­ences in the em­pha­sis on health­care per­sist to this day.</p>
