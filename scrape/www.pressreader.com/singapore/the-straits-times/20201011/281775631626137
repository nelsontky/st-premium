    <p>A Filipino do­mes­tic worker who went cy­cling with two friends on Pu­lau Ubin on Sept 27 ended up in in­ten­sive care for 10 days.</p>
    <p>Ms Calap­ini Mar­ilou Gar­cia, 50, un­der­went two op­er­a­tions be­cause of swelling in her brain.</p>
    <p>Ex­actly what hap­pened to her on that Sun­day out­ing re­mains un­clear as her friends sus­pected some­thing was amiss only af­ter reach­ing the bot­tom of a slope with­out her.</p>
    <p>They back­tracked and were shocked to find Ms Gar­cia ly­ing on the ground in a daze next to her rented bi­cy­cle. All three rid­ers were not wear­ing hel­mets.</p>
    <p>“She was still con­scious. There were no bruises or bleed­ing, but she kept say­ing that she was feel­ing giddy as she was ly­ing on my lap,”</p>
    <p>Ms Clarissa Rig­dao, 43, one of the friends, told The New Pa­per (TNP).</p>
    <p>Two passers-by who stopped to help called the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Ms Rig­dao said her friend started vom­it­ing be­fore the po­lice ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Ms Gar­cia’s em­ployer, Madam Jeanette Mok, told TNP that Ms Gar­cia was con­scious when taken to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, but her con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated quickly.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors had to per­form two pro­ce­dures – the first to insert a pres­sure mon­i­tor into her brain and the sec­ond to re­move a part of her skull to ease the in­creas­ing pres­sure be­cause of swelling in her brain.</p>
    <p>Madam Mok, a 37-year-old cou­ples coun­sel­lor, said: “The sur­geon told us that based on the ar­eas of the brain that were in­jured, she could lose her abil­ity to speak, her mo­tor func­tions and her me­mory.”</p>
    <p>Early last week, though, Ms Gar­cia showed signs of re­cov­ery, as she was able to move her eyes and squeeze her fin­gers.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Madam Mok ar­ranged a video call be­tween Ms Gar­cia and her fam­ily in Ilo­cos Norte prov­ince in the Philip­pines. Ms Gar­cia was able to wave to them, and recog­nised her teenage son.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, she was moved to a high de­pen­dency ward af­ter 10 days in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Ms Gar­cia, who also has a daugh­ter, has been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore for al­most 20 years. She started work­ing for Madam Mok in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Madam Mok said she and her hus­band, Mr Brian Mak, 37, who works in tech­nol­ogy, have been wait­ing anx­iously for good news through­out Ms Gar­cia’s or­deal.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing Ms Gar­cia as re­spon­si­ble, con­sci­en­tious and car­ing, Madam Mok said: “She takes care of us very well. She is also af­fec­tion­ate towards our pet dog and spoils him reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>“This or­deal has been dif­fi­cult be­cause she is a good per­son and we can­not be­lieve some­thing like this has hap­pened to her.”</p>
    <p>Ms Rig­dao, who has known Ms Gar­cia for about five years, de­scribed her friend as cheer­ful and said she was like an older sis­ter to her.</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Lim, Sin­ga­pore Cy­cling Fed­er­a­tion’s vice-pres­i­dent for safety and ed­u­ca­tion, said: “The hel­met is a manda­tory re­quire­ment for any­one cy­cling on Sin­ga­pore roads.</p>
    <p>“Rules aside, it is about tak­ing pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures against se­ri­ous in­juries. A hel­met will pro­tect the cy­clist should he en­counter a fall and run the risk of a se­ri­ous head in­jury.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said cy­clists should bring their own hel­mets when rent­ing bi­cy­cles, as rental of hel­mets may not be fea­si­ble for hy­giene rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Madam Mok said the hos­pi­tal bill has reached $52,000 so far, while the in­sur­ance cov­er­age for Ms Mar­ilou is only up to $20,000.</p>
    <p>Madam Mok and her hus­band have gone on fund-rais­ing plat­form Give.asia to raise money, as the bill is es­ti­mated to ex­ceed $200,000. As at Satur­day af­ter­noon, more than $76,000 had been raised.</p>
