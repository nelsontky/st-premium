    <p>(Florida) • Only two other games in play-off his­tory had fin­ished this way and the last time had been in 1979. So the Mil­wau­kee Bucks were in dis­be­lief af­ter see­ing Jimmy But­ler drain two free throws with no time re­main­ing on the clock, as the Mi­ami Heat came away with a 116-114 Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Eastern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal win on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It capped a wild fin­ish that fea­tured two con­tro­ver­sial calls by the ref­er­ees in the dy­ing se­conds.</p>
    <p>The Heat ap­peared to be in com­mand with a 113-107 ad­van­tage with less than 20 se­conds to go, be­fore Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo and Brook Lopez trimmed the gap to two with 8.5 se­conds left.</p>
    <p>Af­ter But­ler made just one of two free throws for a 114-111 lead with 7.7 se­conds left, Go­ran Dragic, who had a team-high 23 points for Mi­ami, was flagged for a de­bated brush foul as Khris Mid­dle­ton at­tempted a three-pointer.</p>
    <p>When Mid­dle­ton sank all three of his foul shots, scores were tied with 4.3 se­conds left, only for the game to again turn on its head.</p>
    <p>But­ler missed his shot as time ex­pired, only for An­te­tok­oun­mpo to be called for putting a hand on his op­po­nent’s hip dur­ing the fol­lowthrough to set up the game-win­ning free throws.</p>
    <p>The walk-off fin­ish, just the third ever, gave the fifth-seeded Heat a 2-0 lead over the top seeds in the league, leav­ing the Bucks in a state of be­wil­der­ment.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing Most Valu­able Player An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who led all scor­ers with 29 points, was not con­vinced that there was enough con­tact for the foul to be given</p>
    <p>He said: “The refs said there was. Maybe there was, I’ve got to watch the play. I tried to con­test the shot, but they said there was con­tact there, so I’ve got to watch the play.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low All-Star and team­mate Mid­dle­ton, who con­trib­uted 23 points, agreed, adding: “It’s def­i­nitely tough to go out like that, where we didn’t even get a chance at all with no time on the clock.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen that be­fore in a reg­u­lar-sea­son or play­off game. So, it’s def­i­nitely a tough way to go out.”</p>
    <p>Mil­wau­kee coach Mike Bu­den­holzer also voiced his dis­agree­ment with the call, but But­ler, who had 13</p>
    <p>All top-seeded teams trail­ing 2-0 in a best-of-seven play-off se­ries have gone on to lose that se­ries. points, felt it was clear as day.</p>
    <p>“Go­ran made a hel­luva pass on the in­bound... A step-back jumper and I got fouled, pushed me in the back,” he said. “Can’t deny that. Then I had to make one out of two, I made both of them and we win.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing lost twice to the same op­po­nents in the reg­u­lar sea­son and now in the post-sea­son, it ap­pears the Heat are the Bucks’ kryp­tonite.</p>
    <p>They are the 12th team to trail 2-0 in a best-of-seven se­ries af­ter hav­ing the best record in the NBA and the signs do not look good, with all 11 previous teams end­ing up los­ing the se­ries. Game 3 is to­day.</p>
