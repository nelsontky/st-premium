    <p>With the dawn of the new year, and with vac­cines against Covid-19 be­ing de­ployed, there is hope of a pro­gres­sive re­turn to nor­mal life. But even in the post-vac­cine era, ex­pec­ta­tions need to be tem­pered. Leav­ing aside the fact that many coun­tries are still strug­gling with new waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions – even in those that al­ready have vac­cines – the ex­tent of pub­lic ac­cep­tance is un­cer­tain and de­ploy­ment will pose com­plex lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems. It will not be un­til the se­cond half of this year, at best, that some coun­tries will be able to achieve the herd im­mu­nity needed for a sem­blance of nor­malcy to re­turn.</p>
    <p>But a cru­cial ob­sta­cle lies in the fact that the ma­jor­ity of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, who live in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, are un­likely to have ac­cess to vac­cines till at least 2023, ac­cord­ing to health ex­perts. This is partly be­cause vac­cine or­ders from rich and de­vel­oped coun­tries – some of which have booked enough vials to in­oc­u­late their ci­ti­zens many times over – ac­count for the bulk of ex­ist­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity. “Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism”, which had man­i­fested even be­fore pro­duc­tion started, has en­sured that the ma­jor­ity of the world’s pop­u­la­tion spread over sev­eral con­ti­nents will not be cov­ered any time soon and will thus con­tinue to be vul­ner­a­ble to in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, many – if not most – coun­tries will be un­able to open up their economies and could be sub­ject to re­peated lock­downs and over­whelmed health sys­tems for at least two more years. This will not only im­pede global eco­nomic re­cov­ery but, as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has pointed out, also pro­long the pan­demic through con­tin­ued trans­mis­sion of in­fec­tions, even to rich coun­tries. It could also deepen poverty and in­equal­ity, which would have other neg­a­tive con­se­quences, such as ac­cel­er­ated en­vi­ron­men­tal dev­as­ta­tion and so­cial un­rest.</p>
    <p>One of the most ur­gent pri­or­i­ties for 2021 must be to make vac­cines avail­able to as many peo­ple in as many coun­tries as pos­si­ble. An in­ter­na­tional al­liance called Covax aims to pro­vide equal vac­cine ac­cess to all coun­tries, in­clud­ing the poor­est. More than 180 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, have signed up to Covax, a US$2 bil­lion (S$2.6 bil­lion) ini­tia­tive which is sup­ported by the WHO and tar­gets vac­cine ac­cess to at least 20 per cent of all pop­u­la­tions. But its fund­ing is in­suf­fi­cient even to achieve this mod­est goal.</p>
    <p>It must be re­plen­ished, and cover more vac­cines that can be de­ployed prac­ti­cally in the de­vel­op­ing world. In ad­di­tion, man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity needs to be ex­panded and more ge­o­graph­i­cally spread. With their economies likely to re­main de­pressed, poor coun­tries will also need fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance and debt re­lief to cope with higher spend­ing needs. Un­less Covid-19 is de­feated ev­ery­where, it will re­main a threat to all coun­tries – even those that have vac­cines.</p>
