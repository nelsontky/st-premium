    <p>NEW YORK The Min­nesota Tim­ber­wolves started a Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) draft un­like any other on Wed­nes­day by se­lect­ing Ge­or­gia guard An­thony Ed­wards as the first over­all pick.</p>
    <p>Cen­tre James Wise­man went sec­ond to the Golden State War­riors, while guard LaMelo Ball was taken third by the Char­lotte Hor­nets.</p>
    <p>In a draft that was staged vir­tu­ally be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pandemic, with prospects watch­ing from home and team ex­ec­u­tives mak­ing their se­lec­tions from their prac­tice fa­cil­i­ties, NBA Com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver an­nounced the picks from an ESPN tele­vi­sion stu­dio in Bris­tol, Con­necti­cut.</p>
    <p>Un­like in pre­vi­ous drafts, there was no clear favourite for No. 1. Ul­ti­mately, eight months af­ter the Tim­ber­wolves last played a game and about five months af­ter the draft was orig­i­nally sched­uled, Min­nesota went with Ed­wards, a 1.96m shoot­ing guard.</p>
    <p>He was the South-east­ern Con­fer­ence’s fresh­man of the year af­ter av­er­ag­ing 19.1 points and 5.2 re­bounds a game. He was not the best perime­ter shooter, shoot­ing just 29.4 per cent from the college three-point line, but he op­er­ated with NBA-level ath­leti­cism.</p>
    <p>“It’s an in­de­scrib­able feel­ing,” the 19-year-old said.</p>
    <p>The Tim­ber­wolves al­ready have two young stars who they plan to build around. Karl-An­thony Towns, 25, and D’An­gelo Russell, 24, have both been All-Stars, and Ed­wards could fit nicely in the back­court along­side the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>As part of their com­pre­hen­sive draft research, Min­nesota’s front of­fice con­ducted more than 1,000 in­ter­views in re­cent months. They also com­piled player as­sess­ments in nearly 50 cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing play­ers’ psy­cho­log­i­cal make-up.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had to guard against in­for­ma­tion over­load be­cause that is a real thing,” Tim­ber­wolves coach Ryan Saun­ders said.</p>
    <p>The draft was over­shad­owed in part by an in­jury War­riors guard Klay Thomp­son suf­fered to his right leg in a work­out. The sever­ity of his in­jury was un­known but he missed all of last season af­ter tear­ing his an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment in the 2019 NBA Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>While that news was still cir­cu­lat­ing, the War­riors se­lected Wise­man. Re­garded as the top big man in the draft, the 2.16m Wise­man played in just three games as a fresh­man at the Univer­sity of Mem­phis be­fore he ran into el­i­gi­bil­ity prob­lems with the Na­tional Col­le­giate Ath­letic As­so­ci­a­tion. He was dom­i­nant in those games, av­er­ag­ing 19.7 points, 10.7 re­bounds and three blocks while shoot­ing 76.9 per cent from the field.</p>
    <p>Ball’s path to the NBA was un­con­ven­tional. Like his 23-year-old brother Lonzo, who plays for the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans, LaMelo has been scru­ti­nised from a young age.</p>
    <p>His ad­vanced skills (he once scored 92 points in a game as a high school sopho­more) are part of the rea­son, but it is also be­cause of the pro­mo­tional work done on his be­half by his fa­ther, LaVar.</p>
    <p>Ball left high school early to play in Lithua­nia, then spent last season with the Illawarra Hawks in Aus­tralia’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball League. There, he re­vealed his po­ten­tial, av­er­ag­ing 17 points, 7.5 re­bounds and 7.0 as­sists in 12 games.</p>
    <p>The NBA draft typ­i­cally rev­els in glam­our and Sil­ver said he felt bad for the play­ers the event had to be held vir­tu­ally. “It’s a big dis­ap­point­ment,” he said. “We owe them a big party.”</p>
