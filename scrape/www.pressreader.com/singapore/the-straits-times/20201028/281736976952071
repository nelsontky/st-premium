    <p>About 1,300 jobs are on of­fer in the lo­gis­tics sec­tor, with one in three for PMETs, or pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>Th­ese make up over 60 per cent of the more than 2,100 job, trainee­ship and train­ing open­ings avail­able as at the end of last month, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) in its weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The PMET jobs in­clude roles such as re­gional busi­ness sales man­agers and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­agers, with monthly salaries of be­tween $4,000 and $7,000. The me­dian monthly pay is $5,000.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the salary for lo­gis­tics man­agers is $3,700 to $7,250 a month, with a me­dian of $5,500.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the jobs – about 64 per cent – are non-PMET roles as the sec­tor re­quires a work­force for func­tions such as ware­hous­ing, trans­port and value-added ser­vices like la­belling and pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Th­ese non-PMET jobs in­clude roles for trans­port clerks, who typ­i­cally re­ceive monthly salaries of $1,900 to $2,400, with a me­dian of $2,175. Ma­te­rial and freight han­dling work­ers earn be­tween $1,600 and $2,350 monthly, with a me­dian of $2,050.</p>
    <p>Apart from jobs, there are about 510 com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments, as well as 290 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The min­istry dis­closed that about 710 peo­ple were placed into jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing po­si­tions in the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try be­tween April and last month.</p>
    <p>Nearly 600 of them found jobs, and more than 40 per cent of th­ese peo­ple were ma­ture work­ers. Oth­ers have en­rolled in at­tach­ment and trainee­ship pro­grammes, such as in lo­gis­tics an­a­lyt­ics and sup­ply chain man­age­ment, since June.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers in the sec­tor are open to job seek­ers with work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence in other sec­tors, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo at a vir­tual me­dia con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter a visit to Ger­man lo­gis­tics firm DB Schenker’s Red Lion fa­cil­ity in Changi, she noted that th­ese work­ers bring a wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence and net­works from other sec­tors that can help lo­gis­tics firms fur­ther their busi­ness in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic, the sec­tor has suf­fered a se­vere drop in air­freight ca­pac­ity, a short­age of work­ers be­cause of bor­der lock­downs, and lower ef­fi­ciency ow­ing to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But its ef­fects on the in­dus­try have been un­even.</p>
    <p>Those serv­ing hard-hit sec­tors, such as avi­a­tion and aero­space, saw a steeper de­cline in busi­ness, while those pro­vid­ing e-com­merce and last-mile ful­fil­ment ser­vices as well as those serv­ing crit­i­cal sec­tors like health­care saw a surge in de­mand.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that were able to adapt swiftly to snap up new busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties aris­ing from the pan­demic also re­mained re­silient, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Over the years, many lo­gis­tics firms have adopted new tech­nol­ogy and ca­pa­bil­i­ties, in­clud­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ro­bot­ics, as part of their trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts and cre­ated higher-value roles in the process.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has sped up the growth of e-com­merce ser­vices and adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>To sup­port the in­dus­try’s labour needs, Work­force Sin­ga­pore has worked with firms to take in work­ers from hard-hit sec­tors, such as aero­space, avi­a­tion and ho­tel sec­tor, on a sec­ond­ment ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April and last month, nearly 380 work­ers in th­ese hard­hit sec­tors con­tin­ued work­ing via such ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>When asked about the low start­ing pay for non-PMET jobs, Mrs Teo said it is im­por­tant to have a spec­trum of op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Of course, ev­ery­one would like to get the job that of­fers them the best over­all pack­age, but a lot of job seek­ers are quite for­ward-think­ing,” she noted.</p>
    <p>“Of­ten, the job seeker will also con­sider what is the prospect for fur­ther de­vel­op­ment. In lo­gis­tics, given that it is still a growth area... that path­way is avail­able to peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power dis­closed that about 710 peo­ple were placed into jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing po­si­tions in the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try be­tween April and last month. Nearly 600 of them found jobs, and more than 40 per cent of th­ese peo­ple were ma­ture work­ers.</p>
