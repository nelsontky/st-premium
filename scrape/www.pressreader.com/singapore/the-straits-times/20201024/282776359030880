    <p>Opel floun­dered un­der the own­er­ship of Gen­eral Mo­tors. The Ger­man brand was taken over in 2017 by PSA Group, the French cor­po­ra­tion which owns Peu­geot and Citroen.</p>
    <p>Will Opel’s for­tunes change? Quite likely, if you con­sider how cur­rent cars made by the PSA Group have pos­si­bly the best mix of power, re­fine­ment, com­fort, han­dling and value.</p>
    <p>The group’s trans­for­ma­tion started with the Peu­geot 3008, a well-equipped cross­over with Ja­panese pric­ing but the ride and han­dling of a lux­ury tourer.</p>
    <p>The first Opels here to use PSA plat­forms and driv­e­trains were the Cross­land X and Grand­land X in 2017 and 2018, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The new Opel Corsa is the lat­est. The sub­com­pact hatch mea­sur­ing 4,055mm long by 1,745mm wide is pow­ered by the same 1.2-litre turbo en­gine in the far big­ger Cross­land and Grand­land. So, it is quite nippy, clock­ing the zero to 100kmh sprint in 8.7 sec­onds and top­ping out at 208kmh.</p>
    <p>The en­gine is mated to an eight­speed au­to­matic trans­mis­sion from Ja­pan’s Aisin, mak­ing the Corsa the small­est car to have many cogs in its gear­box. Per­son­ally, I find that a six-speeder is bet­ter suited to the car’s 1.2-litre power plant.</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the Corsa feels quite quick – in fact, quicker than its cen­tury-sprint tim­ing sug­gests. But its throt­tle re­sponse is not al­ways lin­ear – you get a bit of lag and then a huge surge.</p>
    <p>Down­shifts can some­times be a bit jud­dery too. The car is firmly sprung to en­hance han­dling, which the Opel ex­cels in. But this is at some ex­pense to ride com­fort.</p>
    <p>The weak­est link is the brakes, which are ex­tremely hard to mod­u­late, es­pe­cially in city traf­fic. This trans­lates to jerkier stop-start progress than nec­es­sary and, when com­bined with the hard sus­pen­sion, it makes the car not so com­fort­able for pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The test-car av­er­aged al­most 8 litres/100km, which is far from Opel’s de­clared fig­ure of 4.7 litres/100km, and fairly high for a small 1.2-litre car.</p>
    <p>And as you would ex­pect of a sub­com­pact, rear hip­room and legroom are lim­ited. The Corsa has a 2,540mm wheel­base, which is merely 2.3 per cent shorter than the Honda City’s, but it feels ap­pre­cia­bly more cramped than the Honda.</p>
    <p>The Opel is chock-full of pre­mium fea­tures. You get the stylish and tac­tile joy­stick-style trans­mis­sion lever found in new cars by the PSA Group.</p>
    <p>There is also a key­less sys­tem, elec­tronic park­ing brake, drive mode se­lect, cruise con­trol, lane­keep­ing, park­ing as­sis­tance with 360-de­gree re­v­erse cam­era and LED head­lights.</p>
    <p>In the cabin, you will find wire­less phone charg­ing, dual-zone cli­mate con­trol (which could be a bit more pow­er­ful), a digital in­stru­ment clus­ter and an in­fo­tain­ment touch­screen with Ap­ple CarPlay and An­droid Auto.</p>
    <p>Else­where, you get the so­lid­ity of a Ger­man car. What you do not get are ex­ter­nal noises. But you can still hear the Corsa’s throaty ex­haust, which is as emo­tive as one pro­duced by a far big­ger en­gine.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the new car is a huge leap from the last Corsa launched here in 2008. That car, made un­der GM own­er­ship, had a 90hp 1.4-litre non-turbo en­gine and a four-speed au­to­box, and took 14.8 sec­onds to hit 100kmh.</p>
    <p>The Corsa’s big­gest ri­val is its donor car, the Peu­geot 208. But since the lat­ter is not avail­able cur­rently, the Opel has the un­di­vided at­ten­tion of those seek­ing a semi­hot hatch with lots of bells and whis­tles at a com­pet­i­tive price.</p>
