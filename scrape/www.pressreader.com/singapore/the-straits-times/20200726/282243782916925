    <p>Go­ing vir­tual as a sub­sti­tute for the real thing has been pretty dis­mal.</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, I went on an on­line guided tour of old Prague. It was meant to be a spooky tour and to her credit, the guide used the spook­i­est of all the pre­sen­ta­tion soft­ware: Mi­crosoft Pow­erPoint.</p>
    <p>On this slide show – made up of drab tourist shots of crypts, gal­lows and haunted vestibules – the part that filled me and three friends with the most dread was the thought that our guide might catch us mid-yawn.</p>
    <p>You can do a lot of things on­line, but send­ing scares from the Czech Repub­lic to Sin­ga­pore isn’t one of them. Maybe if she had used a creepier font?</p>
    <p>Then I was asked to look into the other thing that was go­ing on­line be­cause of the pan­demic: club­bing.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal clubs have or­gan­ised vir­tual par­ties, but what could that pos­si­bly look like?</p>
    <p>One Satur­day night, I logged in to find out. I guess my ex­pec­ta­tions were too high. With the shut­down of clubs lead­ing to mas­sive rev­enue losses, I reck­oned or­gan­is­ers would jump into mak­ing the on­line ex­pe­ri­ence a shot of pure adren­a­line to the eye­balls. Maybe there would be crazy out­fits, writhing bodies, a menagerie of ex­otic an­i­mals, fire breathers and con­tor­tion­ists. Maybe even fire-breath­ing con­tor­tion­ists.</p>
    <p>I saw a guy on a turntable. And that was it.</p>
    <p>The on­line club ex­pe­ri­ence had the en­ergy of a den­tist’s wait­ing room and the vibe of a tax ac­coun­tancy Zoom con­fer­ence drag­ging into its sec­ond hour.</p>
    <p>From the text scrolling down next to the im­age, there ap­peared to be fewer than a dozen par­tic­i­pants logged in, re­mind­ing me of Chi­nese street opera per­for­mances play­ing to empty grass fields. Ev­ery­one was fine with it be­cause the ghosts were the real au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Club­bing when stripped of crowds feels tragic be­cause crowds are the elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tors. As with ev­ery kind of live event, in­clud­ing po­lit­i­cal ral­lies and protest marches, danc­ing with­out bodies feels like the em­peror’s new clothes. It is a guy stand­ing at a con­sole look­ing at a black disc go­ing round and round, play­ing for ghosts.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest use of vir­tual con­fer­enc­ing has been for con­duct­ing in­ter­views. With the cam­era switched on, I be­come a dou­ble act. It’s me and my back­ground, lead­ing to ques­tions such as: “Are you in a cup­board?” and “Is your of­fice in a store­room?”</p>
    <p>The an­swer to both is no. I am in my bed­room. My taste in stor­age so­lu­tions runs to in­dus­trial chic, some­times called bru­tal­ist; namely, I got a deal on 50 yel­low bins of the kind seen in hard­ware stores for screws and bot­tles of clean­ing fluid, which were then lined up on bolted steel shelv­ing, which was also go­ing cheap.</p>
    <p>I should hang a bed sheet be­hind me if I am that an­noyed by ques­tions about whether my home is an un­der­ground bunker or re­fur­bished abat­toir.</p>
    <p>But of late, I have be­come proud of my op­pres­sive sur­round­ings, which serve as a re­minder of the hu­man con­di­tion in 2020. Also, it’s easy to reach be­hind me and grab a screw­driver should my diesel gen­er­a­tor need a quick tune-up in the mid­dle of a Zoom call.</p>
    <p>The move to vir­tu­al­ity caused by the pan­demic has ex­posed a cou­ple of facts. Peo­ple stuck at home want to watch, but they also want to par­tic­i­pate. Live-streamed durian and seafood auc­tions are boom­ing be­cause of the two-way in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The host mat­ters. I can look as glum as I want at Zoom meet­ings, but dee­jays and tour guides should know they are putting on a show. At least smile and make eye con­tact with the cam­era once in a while. They need to look like they want to be there, that this is their play­ground. They should not be­have as if they are slum­ming it be­cause it’s not “real”.</p>
    <p>For those of us stuck at home, in our in­dus­trial tool sheds and fac­tory warehouses en­closed by steel shelves, it is all the re­al­ity we have.</p>
