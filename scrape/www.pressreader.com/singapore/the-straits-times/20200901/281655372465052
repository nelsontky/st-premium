    <p>Less than a week af­ter it was an­nounced that the min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salaries for Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) hold­ers will be i ncreased, labour MP Patrick Tay (Pi­o­neer) urged the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) to con­sider fur­ther rais­ing this min­i­mum pay for two sec­tors: in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy and pro­fes­sional ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional ser­vices in­clude law, ac­coun­tancy and con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>The two sec­tors gen­er­ally have more com­pa­nies on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices, Mr Tay, as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC), said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day .</p>
    <p>This was among sev­eral sug­ges­tions he made on strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­porean core, in his speech that started the par­lia­men­tary de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“The dis­rup­tion brought about by Covid-19 and the re­sult­ing eco­nomic re­ces­sion has sur­faced ground con­cerns on the in­creased com­pe­ti­tion for jobs and em­ploy­ment. In this re­gard, we must up­hold our pil­lar of mer­i­toc­racy. There must be fair­ness and equal treat­ment and as­sess­ment of work­ers, which is also a fun­da­men­tal In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion com­mit­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has an­nounced two in­creases this year in the salary thresh­old for EP hold­ers. The sec­ond was an­nounced last Thurs­day and will start from to­day for new ap­pli­ca­tions, rais­ing the thresh­old to $4,500, from $3,900.</p>
    <p>For the first time, the min­istry set a higher bar for the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor, with the min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salary for new ap­pli­cants go­ing up to $5,000 from Dec 1.</p>
    <p>The changes af­fect pass re­newals from May next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said that since the an­nounce­ment, union lead­ers and pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) have told him they worry em­ploy­ers would merely raise the salaries or repack­age the com­pen­sa­tion and ben­e­fits of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) to meet the rules, and re­tain them.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean staff per­form­ing sim­i­lar or the same j obs as the for­eign PMETs may not get a sim­i­lar pay hike, re­sult­ing in “se­ri­ous par­ity is­sues”, he added.</p>
    <p>He pledged that unions would watch closely the ac­tions of unionised com­pa­nies, and en­cour­aged work­ers in non-unionised com­pa­nies to be union mem­bers to get bet­ter pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­porean core of PMETs must be ad­dressed at all lev­els of the hi­er­ar­chy, he said.</p>
    <p>Some large com­pa­nies with deep pock­ets, he noted, may hire more Sin­ga­pore­ans at ju­nior lev­els to make the firm look bet­ter in terms of the pro­por­tion of lo­cals it em­ploys.</p>
    <p>The hir­ing cul­ture and mind­sets need to be changed across the board, he added.</p>
    <p>Among other things, Mr Tay, who chairs the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Ed­u­ca­tion, also sug­gested the Govern­ment im­pose manda­tory au­dits and penal­ties on</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has an­nounced two in­creases this year in the salary thresh­old for Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers. The sec­ond was an­nounced last Thurs­day and will start to­day for new ap­pli­ca­tions, rais­ing the thresh­old to $4,500, from $3,900.</p>
