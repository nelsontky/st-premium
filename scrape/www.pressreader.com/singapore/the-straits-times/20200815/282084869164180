    <p>Nearly 250 mil­lion years ago, a very odd rep­tile pa­trolled the shore­lines and coves of the Tri­as­sic Alps. Called Tanys­tro­pheus, it had a toothy head and a body echo­ing that of mod­ern mon­i­tor lizards. But be­tween them stretched a hor­i­zon­tal, gi­raffe-like neck.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion of how this 6m-long crea­ture used that 2.7m-long neck has be­dev­illed pa­le­on­tol­o­gists for more than 100 years, and it is seen as “one of the most baf­fling an­i­mals that ever lived”, said Mr Stephan Spiek­man, a pa­le­on­tol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Zurich, in Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>“How could this an­i­mal even breathe or swal­low? And then there is the evo­lu­tion­ary ques­tion: Why on earth did this an­i­mal evolve this ridicu­lously long neck?”</p>
    <p>But re­search pub­lished in Cur­rent Bi­ol­ogy, in­clud­ing a new re­con­struc­tion of its skull, shows ev­i­dence that its body was primed for an aquatic hunt­ing strat­egy and that the crea­ture came in two va­ri­eties: reg­u­lar and minia­ture-size.</p>
    <p>Tanys­tro­pheus was ini­tially de­scribed in the 1850s, based on a few tube-like bones. Only in the 1930s, when more com­plete fos­sils emerged from the Monte San Gior­gio in Switzer­land, did sci­en­tists re­alise they were look­ing at neck ver­te­brae from a strange rep­tile whose way of life they could not fig­ure out.</p>
    <p>It took decades un­til pa­le­on­tol­o­gist Karl Tschanz showed in 1988 that ribs un­der­neath the neck ver­te­brae in­ter­locked, form­ing a hor­i­zon­tal and ex­tremely stiff neck. That sug­gested an aquatic life­style, Mr Spiek­man said, be­cause such an un­bend­ing neck would have made life on land in­con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>But pa­le­on­tol­o­gists con­tin­ued to ar­gue whether Tanys­tro­pheus ac­tively pur­sued un­der­wa­ter prey or perched on­shore, us­ing its long neck like a fish­ing pole.</p>
    <p>To con­found matters, digs had found mul­ti­ple skele­tons of smaller Tanys­tro­pheus on Monte San Gior­gio. If they be­longed to ju­ve­niles, as some sug­gested, why did they have dif­fer­ent teeth?</p>
    <p>Mr Spiek­man’s team sought an­swers first by CT-scan­ning a spec­i­men of Tanys­tro­pheus’ head from a Zurich mu­seum and re­build­ing it, which proved dif­fi­cult be­cause “all the bones were jum­bled to­gether and be­cause the skull of Tanys­tro­pheus is very dif­fer­ent from other rep­tiles in many re­spects”.</p>
    <p>“I very clearly re­mem­ber the day the model was fin­ished and I was the first to see the face of this an­i­mal after 242 mil­lion years,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­con­structed skull re­vealed sev­eral aquatic adap­ta­tions: nos­trils po­si­tioned on the top of the snout, like a croc­o­dile, and long, curved fangs. In­stead of pur­su­ing prey ac­tively, Mr Spiek­man said, it prob­a­bly am­bushed prey in murky wa­ter, lung­ing for­ward with its long neck to snap up fish.</p>
    <p>To test whether the bones of the smaller Tanys­tro­pheus be­longed to ju­ve­niles or a sep­a­rate species, the team stud­ied thin sec­tions of bone pre­pared by Mr Spiek­man’s su­per­vi­sor and co-author, Dr Torsten</p>
    <p>Scheyer. A close look at the lit­tle bones’ in­te­rior re­vealed clear signs of a fully grown adult. That meant that two dis­tinct species of Tanys­tro­pheus were co-ex­ist­ing in the same wa­ters: one large, one mini.</p>
    <p>The two closely re­lated an­i­mals seem to have gone after dif­fer­ent types of prey, the team re­ports, in an ex­am­ple of the phe­nom­e­non known as niche par­ti­tion­ing. The larger an­i­mal – newly named Tanys­tro­pheus hy­droides – used its spiked teeth for hunt­ing fish and squid; the smaller species’ teeth point to­wards a diet of marine in­ver­te­brates such as shrimp.</p>
    <p>With two mys­ter­ies solved, Mr Spiek­man and his team hope to take a fresh look at the biome­chan­ics of the j aws and that l ong, strange neck. He said: “Peo­ple al­ways thought that Tanys­tro­pheus was an evo­lu­tion­ary dead end.</p>
    <p>“But the fact that Tanys­tro­pheus evolved into dif­fer­ent species with very dif­fer­ent life­styles in­di­cates that Tanys­tro­pheus and its neck were quite suc­cess­ful in evo­lu­tion­ary terms.”</p>
    <p>It took decades un­til pa­le­on­tol­o­gist Karl Tschanz showed in 1988 that ribs un­der­neath the neck ver­te­brae in­ter­locked, form­ing a hor­i­zon­tal and ex­tremely stiff neck. That sug­gested an aquatic life­style, Mr Spiek­man said, be­cause such an un­bend­ing neck would have made life on land in­con­ve­nient.</p>
