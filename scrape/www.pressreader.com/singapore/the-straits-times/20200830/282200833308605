    <p>Three years ago, Ms Alyssa Reinoso, 29, went from new­ly­wed to wi­dow in four months.</p>
    <p>Long be­fore they be­gan dat­ing in 2014, her hus­band Tyler Hung had been strug­gling with bipo­lar dis­or­der. He al­ter­nated be­tween de­pres­sive episodes and ex­treme highs, when he was hy­per­ac­tive, so­cia­ble and the life of the party. In 2015, a close friend with the same dis­or­der took his life, com­pound­ing Mr Hung’s in­tense lows.</p>
    <p>Liken­ing bipo­lar dis­or­der to a chronic ill­ness that flares up from time to time, she says they had more good times than bad as a cou­ple.</p>
    <p>She re­mem­bers Mr Hung, an en­tre­pre­neur who founded an education con­sul­tancy firm, as in­tel­li­gent, charm­ing and a great con­ver­sa­tion­al­ist. She was op­ti­mistic about the fu­ture, look­ing for­ward to a wed­ding cel­e­bra­tion in Bali they had planned a year af­ter their cer­e­mony at the Reg­istry of Mar­riages in Sin­ga­pore, as well as starting a family to­gether.</p>
    <p>But on bad days, he bat­tled sui­ci­dal thoughts and mood swings. Fear­ing judg­ment, he did not tell family and close friends about his con­di­tion. The si­lence took its toll. Af­ter his pass­ing, many told Ms Reinoso they had no idea he was strug­gling.</p>
    <p>“If you’re go­ing through a de­pres­sive episode, but have to put on a happy face and go through the day, it makes you even more tired at night be­cause you’ve been car­ry­ing around this bur­den,” she says.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the ill­ness got the bet­ter of him in Oc­to­ber 2017 – he ended his life then, at age 29 – she was done keep­ing se­crets.</p>
    <p>“Los­ing some­one to sui­cide is very stig­ma­tis­ing and, by not talk­ing, I felt like peo­ple would spec­u­late fur­ther,” says the con­tent mar­ket­ing man­ager, who is from the Philip­pines and has lived in Sin­ga­pore since 2002.</p>
    <p>When she fi­nally started talk­ing to oth­ers who had lost loved ones, or were strug­gling with men­tal health is­sues, it helped her heal­ing process.</p>
    <p>This year, she went a step fur­ther by team­ing up with Ms Sab­rina Ooi, 29, and Mr Luq­man Mo­hamed, 31, to launch Calm Col­lec­tive (calm­col­lec­tive.asia), a com­mu­nity that pro­motes men­tal well-be­ing through we­bi­nars and on­line con­tent.</p>
    <p>Spurred by the omis­sion of psy­cho­log­i­cal treat­ment from a list of es­sen­tial ser­vices al­lowed to op­er­ate un­der the cir­cuit breaker, the trio want to em­pha­sise the im­por­tance of good men­tal health and help more peo­ple cope with trauma and other is­sues.</p>
    <p>Since its launch in April, they have or­gan­ised about 20 free we­bi­nars of be­tween 45 and 60 min­utes each, cov­er­ing top­ics such as how so­cial me­dia af­fects men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Speak­ers in­clude men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als and well-known per­son­al­i­ties such as mu­si­cians Narelle and Ben­jamin Kheng, who talked about men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>The founders also weigh in on top­ics close to their hearts – Ms Reinoso and Mr Luq­man, whose mother has strug­gled with de­pres­sion, have spo­ken about man­ag­ing a re­la­tion­ship when a per­son has a men­tal health con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, cus­tomer suc­cess man­ager Ms Ooi, who met Ms Reinoso through Mr Hung, shared her ex­pe­ri­ence liv­ing with bipo­lar dis­or­der, in­clud­ing cop­ing mech­a­nisms such as med­i­ca­tion, ther­apy, jour­nal­ing, med­i­ta­tion and ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Through these dis­cus­sions, they want to spark con­ver­sa­tions about men­tal health, nor­malise the seek­ing of treat­ment and re­move judg­ment about men­tal ill­ness be­ing a char­ac­ter flaw or hir­ing bar­rier.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Hung’s se­cret is now out in the open, Ms Reinoso be­lieves he would see the good in it.</p>
    <p>She says: “I never want his death to be in vain, so if his story can help some­one else, at least some­thing pos­i­tive can come out of it.”</p>
