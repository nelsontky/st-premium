    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to digi­tise pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion and make it more user-friendly for the peo­ple. The gov­ern­ment should clearly present its out­look for the fu­ture and a road map.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has an­nounced his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s in­ten­tion to es­tab­lish a dig­i­tal agency as one of its key poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment plans to sub­mit a re­lated Bill to the or­di­nary Diet ses­sion next year.</p>
    <p>Uni­fy­ing dig­i­tal poli­cies that have strad­dled mul­ti­ple min­istries and agen­cies to es­tab­lish a struc­ture to pro­mote digi­ti­sa­tion is highly sig­nif­i­cant. It must be tack­led in a speedy man­ner.</p>
    <p>What should be taken up first is digi­tis­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tive ser­vices of cen­tral gov­ern­ment min­istries and agen­cies and lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>In mea­sures to re­spond to coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, con­fu­sion arose over the on­line ap­pli­ca­tion for the cash ben­e­fit of 100,000 yen (S$1,300) per per­son.</p>
    <p>The shar­ing of in­for­ma­tion on the in­fec­tious dis­ease be­tween the cen­tral and lo­cal gov­ern­ments stalled, and schools were no­to­ri­ously un­pre­pared, such that they were un­able to of­fer re­mote classes. Tele­con­fer­ences be­tween min­istries and agen­cies did not go as smoothly as had been in­tended.</p>
    <p>Such in­ci­dents oc­curred be­cause each min­istry and agency has its own com­puter sys­tem and there is no gov­ern­ment-wide strat­egy.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal agency is en­vi­sioned as serv­ing as a con­trol tower to im­prove such sit­u­a­tions. The chal­lenge will be to cre­ate an ef­fec­tive struc­ture that en­ables a uni­fied re­sponse that tran­scends the ver­ti­cal di­vi­sions of min­istries and agen­cies.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the in­ter­nal gov­ern­ment sys­tems, the gov­ern­ment must also pro­mote digi­ti­sa­tion in var­i­ous ar­eas of so­ci­ety, in­clud­ing the econ­omy, med­i­cal care and wel­fare, and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It must not be for­got­ten that the es­sen­tial pur­pose of digi­ti­sa­tion is to in­crease con­ve­nience for peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal rea­sons for China’s econ­omy</p>
    <p>Zhang Jun</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>De­spite tak­ing a se­ri­ous hit from Covid-19 lock­downs, China’s econ­omy has proved re­silient, although it has not fully bounced back, as some ac­tiv­i­ties, es­pe­cially in the ser­vice sec­tor, can­not be re­vived.</p>
    <p>Yet un­like most of the world, China seems un­likely to be­come mired in a long re­ces­sion, not least be­cause of its rapid dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>China’s dig­i­tal econ­omy was grow­ing strongly be­fore the pan­demic. In 2018, it al­ready ac­counted for 31.3 tril­lion yuan (S$6.3 tril­lion), or 34 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP). While this is only about one-third the size of the United States’ dig­i­tal econ­omy, it rep­re­sents years of growth that out­paced that of nom­i­nal GDP. The Covid-19 cri­sis is set to re­in­force this trend.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has de­stroyed some busi­nesses and in­dus­tries, but it has also greatly ac­cel­er­ated the up­take of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Un­able to leave their homes, peo­ple em­braced shop­ping and cater­ing plat­forms such as JD.com, Meituan, Pin­duo­duo and Eleme, which en­abled them to pur­chase food, oil, veg­eta­bles and other daily ne­ces­si­ties on­line.</p>
    <p>More­over, within a month of clos­ing their class­rooms and evac­u­at­ing their cam­puses, schools and univer­si­ties moved on­line – a shift that spurred the rapid de­vel­op­ment of on­line con­fer­enc­ing and learn­ing plat­forms. Like­wise, com­pa­nies took ad­van­tage of dig­i­tal tools – from com­mu­ni­ca­tion plat­forms like En­ter­prise WeChat and DingTalk to e-con­tracts – to keep their busi­nesses run­ning. More than 20 mil­lion on­line meet­ings, with more than 100 mil­lion to­tal par­tic­i­pants, have been ini­ti­ated on DingTalk in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>Just as tech­nol­ogy helped life go on dur­ing lock­downs, it has en­abled China to roll back re­stric­tions with­out risk­ing pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>A grow­ing num­ber of lo­cal gov­ern­ments are im­ple­ment­ing health code – a mo­bile-phone app that as­signs users a colour code in­di­cat­ing their health sta­tus.</p>
    <p>But the health apps of new dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies ex­tend much fur­ther, and are trans­form­ing China’s en­tire health­care in­dus­try. Be­yond the rise of on­line med­i­ca­tion pur­chases, 5G-based re­mote med­i­cal con­sul­ta­tion plat­forms, such as Ping An Good Doc­tor, have been flour­ish­ing, lay­ing the ground­work for a new in­dus­trial model.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy is also pro­pel­ling re­search and de­vel­op­ment in health.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion is sweep­ing China’s fi­nan­cial in­dus­try. With 562 mil­lion users, China’s mo­bile bank­ing apps were the third-largest cat­e­gory of apps by cus­tomer base – af­ter short-video and shop­ping apps – at the end of March. Chi­nese mo­bile bank­ing apps now av­er­age 50 mil­lion monthly ac­tive users.</p>
    <p>The growth of China’s dig­i­tal econ­omy has been a boon for em­ploy­ment as well. The China In­for­ma­tion and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Tech­nol­ogy Academy re­ports that in 2018, the dig­i­tal econ­omy cre­ated 191 mil­lion jobs and ac­counted for one-quar­ter of over­all em­ploy­ment – an 11.5 per cent year-on-year in­crease.</p>
    <p>China may well be the only ma­jor econ­omy to re­alise pos­i­tive growth this year. It owes this, in no small mea­sure, to a decade of com­mit­ment to heavy in­vest­ment in tech-driven struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Data at the heart of change</p>
    <p>Syafri Ba­har</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post, In­done­sia Covid-19 has put tech­nol­ogy at the heart of many com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer be­hav­iour has shifted dra­mat­i­cally over the past few months, and ever more trans­ac­tions are tak­ing place on­line. While the pan­demic has brought fi­nan­cial and op­er­a­tional chal­lenges to all mar­kets, tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), proves that growth is still pos­si­ble dur­ing times of cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, with its large pop­u­la­tion and deep smart­phone pen­e­tra­tion, presents a huge op­por­tu­nity for data-in­ten­sive tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>At the core of AI lies ma­chine learn­ing, which al­lows ma­chines to learn from a set of ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine that in­stead of think­ing about what rules to tell a ma­chine, we can show ex­am­ples for the ma­chine to learn how to make scal­able de­ci­sions. This is a great ad­van­tage as it al­lows busi­nesses to be more ef­fi­cient and to scale their op­er­a­tions faster.</p>
    <p>Through data-driven/in­formed de­ci­sion mak­ing, you can pre­dict fu­ture trends, iden­tify new op­por­tu­ni­ties, op­ti­mise your cur­rent ef­forts and pro­duce ac­tion­able in­sight more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>A big tech­no­log­i­cal change is hap­pen­ing. Brace your­selves and be the first ones to be pre­pared for the changes.</p>
