    <p>Hong Kong ac­tor Shawn Yue’s wife Sarah Wang has shared a long post on In­sta­gram de­tail­ing the pre­ma­ture birth of her daugh­ter at 28 weeks.</p>
    <p>Yue, 39, mar­ried for­mer Tai­wanese ac­tress Wang, 32, in 2017. The cou­ple have a two-year-old son.</p>
    <p>They had an­nounced the birth of their sec­ond child ear­lier this month on their re­spec­tive so­cial me­dia ac­counts, but said she had ac­tu­ally been born ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Yue wrote in a post dated Dec 5: “At the time she was born, she was still in the dan­ger zone, so we kept quiet about it. But now she has made it through and has come home with us.”</p>
    <p>Wang shared more de­tails of the cou­ple’s or­deal in an In­sta­gram post on Wed­nes­day. She re­vealed that their baby was born at just 28 weeks and was put into the in­ten­sive care unit fol­low­ing her birth.</p>
    <p>A typ­i­cal preg­nancy is around 40 weeks and a full-term preg­nancy is at least 37 weeks.</p>
    <p>Wang re­vealed she had a dif­fi­cult preg­nancy and had been in the hospi­tal for ob­ser­va­tion even be­fore she gave birth. “The doc­tor told me to at least make it to 28 weeks. If I could last till then, the chances of my baby’s sur­vival will in­crease by a lot. I felt so de­pressed hear­ing that. I never thought this would hap­pen to me.”</p>
    <p>When her waters broke at 28 weeks, she burst into tears, wor­ried about her baby. She broke down again see­ing her daugh­ter in an in­cu­ba­tor af­ter de­liv­ery. She wrote: “When I saw how many tubes were at­tached to her tiny 1,000g body, I felt such heartache.</p>
    <p>I did not pro­tect her well, why does she have to suf­fer so much?”</p>
    <p>Yue, she added, got emo­tional as well. “Shawn told me he could not stop cry­ing the first time he saw our daugh­ter. To be hon­est, in the en­tire time we’ve known each other, I’ve seen him only get tearyeyed. He’s a very strong man, I know he must have felt such pain.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s child is now safe and has been dis­charged from the hospi­tal. Wang thanked the med­i­cal team, her friends, fam­ily and her hus­band for be­ing her pil­lars of sup­port dur­ing this try­ing time.</p>
    <p>Yue left a mes­sage for his wife in the com­ments sec­tion, say­ing: “You’ve worked hard.”</p>
