    <p>Dif­fer­ences in cul­tures and back­grounds will al­ways ex­ist in an ur­banised so­ci­ety like Singapore, and there is a need to con­tinue hav­ing dis­cus­sions about race and di­ver­sity be­yond Racial Har­mony Day, Am­bas­sador-at-Large Ong Keng Yong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, who was speak­ing at a vir­tual book launch, said he is of­ten asked why there is a need for Racial Har­mony Day, which was yes­ter­day, but was marked in schools last week ahead of this week’s hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>He pointed to a re­cent case where the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) re­moved a Chi­nese-lan­guage chil­dren’s book for re­view af­ter it was flagged for racist con­tent, as well as other in­stances where Sin­ga­pore­ans have “pre­con­ceived no­tions” about oth­ers from dif­fer­ent eth­nic or re­li­gious back­grounds, as rea­sons why Singapore still needs con­ver­sa­tions and pro­grammes to foster greater un­der­stand­ing of race and di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Such ef­forts need to go be­yond Racial Har­mony Day, and be sus­tained in schools and in so­ci­ety, he said. “It’s nec­es­sary for us to start this kind of aware­ness build­ing right from an early age... and as we go up the ed­u­ca­tional lad­der, we be­come more so­phis­ti­cated in ex­press­ing our­selves,” added Mr Ong, who is ex­ec­u­tive deputy chair­man of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (RSIS).</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the launch of the book Faith, Iden­tity, Co­he­sion, which seeks to con­tinue con­ver­sa­tions from the In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on Co­he­sive So­ci­eties that Singapore hosted in June last year. The launch was or­gan­ised by the RSIS and World Sci­en­tific Pub­lish­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said Racial Har­mony Day is a timely oc­ca­sion for Singapore to reaf­firm its com­mit­ment to social co­he­sion. “Amidst the Covid-19 pan­demic, it is even more im­por­tant that we pre­serve our close and har­mo­nious ties among dif­fer­ent races and re­li­gions, which do not come by chance,” she said on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said the task of strength­en­ing racial har­mony is one that de­mands con­stant ef­fort and en­gage­ment, and each new gen­er­a­tion will have dif­fer­ent life ex­pe­ri­ences and ref­er­ence points which shape their views on race and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>His gen­er­a­tion, for in­stance, were “in­deli­bly marked” by the race ri­ots in the 1960s, while to­day’s gen­er­a­tion are ex­posed to global is­sues such as the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment, he said in a post.</p>
    <p>“The older gen­er­a­tion are more cau­tious when talk­ing about race and re­li­gion, hav­ing seen past strife and the hard work put in to achieve the har­mony we en­joy to­day. Youth are more open about these mat­ters, and more will­ing to talk about sen­si­tive topics,” noted PM Lee. “Val­ues and views will nat­u­rally evolve over time, but what is im­por­tant is that we never take our peace for granted,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral re­cent i nci­dents have sparked de­bate and served as a re­minder on racial sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture book un­der re­view by NLB fea­tures a “dark-skinned” boy with “oily curly hair” as an ag­gres­sive school bully. Li­brary user Estella Young, 42, had called it “as­tound­ingly racist”, not­ing that the vil­lain was be­ing writ­ten about in “ex­plic­itly racialised terms, and in con­trast to all the other char­ac­ters who are de­picted as fair-skinned”.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent, Face­book user Parvi­tar Singh re­lated on Mon­day about how he had ap­plied to an or­gan­i­sa­tion for work but was told that it might not be com­fort­able with the fact that he wore a tur­ban. Yes­ter­day, it is­sued an apol­ogy to Mr Singh af­ter his Face­book post re­count­ing the in­ci­dent went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>In­ci­dents like these un­der­score the need for Sin­ga­pore­ans to have more open and re­spect­ful con­ver­sa­tions about race, said ed­u­ca­tional con­sul­tant Kan­chana Varathara­jalu, 36, who worked with a group of about 10 vol­un­teers from the not-for-profit col­lec­tive Better.sg to start a web­site, okay­ornot.sg.</p>
    <p>The site, launched yes­ter­day, pro­vides sev­eral tools and re­sources to spur such con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Many pre-schools also marked Racial Har­mony Day with cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties. At Pat’s School­house in Aroozoo Av­enue, run by Busy Bees Singapore, more than 200 chil­dren wore tra­di­tional eth­nic cos­tumes and played tra­di­tional games such as hop­scotch and mar­bles.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren at eight pre-schools in Sem­bawang and Ad­mi­ralty run by PCF Sparkle­tots also sam­pled var­i­ous tra­di­tional dishes, such as putu mayam (string hop­pers) and tang yuan (gluti­nous rice balls).</p>
    <p>NEVER TAKE PEACE FOR GRANTED</p>
    <p>The older gen­er­a­tion are more cau­tious when talk­ing about race and re­li­gion, hav­ing seen past strife and the hard work put in to achieve the har­mony we en­joy to­day. Youth are more open about these mat­ters, and more will­ing to talk about sen­si­tive topics. Val­ues and views will nat­u­rally evolve over time, but what is im­por­tant is that we never take our peace for ’’ granted.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG, on how strength­en­ing racial har­mony de­mands con­stant ef­fort and en­gage­ment, and how each new gen­er­a­tion will have dif­fer­ent life ex­pe­ri­ences and ref­er­ence points which shape their views on race and re­li­gion.</p>
