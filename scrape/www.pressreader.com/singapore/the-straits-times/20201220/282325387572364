    <p>A jaunt through Chi­na­town or Kam­pong Glam will do for first-time vis­i­tors to Sin­ga­pore, but tour op­er­a­tors have had to up their game to at­tract res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Many launched new prod­ucts such as food, her­itage, boat­ing and walk­ing tours in un­der-the-radar neigh­bour­hoods. Priced to woo a savvy lo­cal crowd, many of­fered good value.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, an Eat, Play, Love Sin­ga­pore River Walk cre­ated by lo­cal op­er­a­tor Mon­ster Day Tours and Sin­ga­pore River One, which man­ages the precinct, cost $35 for a 31/ 2- hour tour. It in­cluded food and drinks at five stops, such as Ra­men Keisuke Lob­ster King and Ren­dezvous restau­rant, which serves nasi padang.</p>
    <p>Be­sides hear­ing nuggets about the Sin­ga­pore River and vis­it­ing scenic spots, par­tic­i­pants would re­ceive a $10 food voucher valid at any of this year’s Sin­ga­pore River Sig­na­tures winning restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Vir­tual travel also took flight this year, as lock­downs drove peo­ple to seek a men­tal es­cape.</p>
    <p>Home-shar­ing plat­form Airbnb in April launched on­line ex­pe­ri­ences, bring­ing peo­ple into one an­other’s liv­ing rooms and kitchens to learn skills such as pasta-mak­ing or fla­menco danc­ing.</p>
    <p>One could spend an hour meet­ing sheep from a farm in Bri­tain and, in the next, fol­low a “plague doc­tor” around Prague to learn about the Black Death.</p>
    <p>And around the world, nat­u­ral at­trac­tions such as Yosemite Na­tional Park in Cal­i­for­nia and Ire­land’s Cliffs of Mo­her of­fered grand, sweep­ing views of the sur­round­ings via free vir­tual tours.</p>
    <p>As tourism re­cov­ers, the pop­u­lar­ity of vir­tual tours is likely to wane.</p>
    <p>But the next time you are plan­ning a trip abroad, per­haps you might de­cide if a place is worth head­ing to by first vis­it­ing it on­line.</p>
