    <p>At the 2020 Emmy Awards, it was time for a show that never re­ceived much recog­ni­tion to shine.</p>
    <p>“The In­ter­net is gonna turn on me,” said a sheep­ish Schitt’s Creek co-cre­ator and ac­tor Dan Levy as he took one of the seven Primetime Em­mys in to­tal that the Cana­dian sit­com won (from 15 nom­i­na­tions; the show also won two Cre­ative Arts Em­mys) on Sun­day night in Los An­ge­les (yes­ter­day morn­ing Sin­ga­pore time). This is the most num­ber of Emmy wins in a sin­gle sea­son for a com­edy se­ries.</p>
    <p>Not bad for a show that only be­gan show­ing up on the Emmy radar af­ter its fifth sea­son last year, when it gar­nered four nom­i­na­tions and no wins.</p>
    <p>This year, af­ter its sixth and fi­nal sea­son, the sit­com about a wealthy fam­ily forced to live in a small town af­ter go­ing broke won Out­stand­ing</p>
    <p>Com­edy Se­ries, Out­stand­ing Lead Ac­tor in a Com­edy Se­ries for Eu­gene Levy and Out­stand­ing Lead Ac­tress in a Com­edy Se­ries for Catherine O’Hara, among oth­ers in per­form­ing, writ­ing and di­rect­ing.</p>
    <p>The sweep was not quite an up­set as the fi­nal sea­son earned praise from crit­ics and was strongly tipped to be a big win­ner in a tur­bu­lent year that many felt needed a show that was sunny and ac­cept­ing of diversity.</p>
    <p>Also, since its de­but on Amer­i­can Net­flix in 2017, it had built a fan base that the Emmy vot­ers, who in the past have leaned to­wards pres­tige come­dies such as Ama­zon Prime Video’s The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, could not af­ford to ig­nore.</p>
    <p>A big­ger sur­prise was the come­back of ca­ble gi­ant HBO.</p>
    <p>The stream­ing ser­vice Net­flix swag­gered into Emmy sea­son with 160 nom­i­na­tions, giv­ing it the biggest lead it has ever en­joyed against tra­di­tional Emmy pow­er­house HBO, with its 107 nods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, wins by HBO’s su­per­hero se­ries Watch­men (11 awards) and cor­po­rate dy­nasty drama Suc­ces­sion (seven awards) helped push the ca­ble channel to the top.</p>
    <p>In­clud­ing its Cre­ative Arts wins, HBO has 30 Em­mys ver­sus Net­flix’s 21, putting them at No. 1 and No. 2 po­si­tions re­spec­tively in the stu­dio rank­ings.</p>
    <p>Stream­ing ser­vice Ap­ple TV+, launched in the United States last year, picked up its first Primetime Emmy when Billy Crudup won Out­stand­ing Sup­port­ing Ac­tor in a Drama Se­ries for his role in work­place drama The Morn­ing Show.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier last week, an­other stream­ing ser­vice l aunched last year, Dis­ney+, picked up its first Em­mys, in the Cre­ative Arts cat­e­gories which hon­our mainly tech­ni­cal achieve­ments. It earned seven Em­mys in to­tal for its Star Wars spin-off se­ries, The Man­dalo­rian.</p>
    <p>HBO re­ceived a boost to the top, thanks in part to the shock win by Zen­daya in the Out­stand­ing Lead Ac­tress in a Drama Se­ries cat­e­gory for Eu­pho­ria – an hon­our now trend­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The bira­cial singer-ac­tress, 24, be­came the youngest win­ner in the cat­e­gory af­ter beat­ing cat­e­gory favourites Laura Lin­ney (crime thriller Ozark), Jen­nifer Anis­ton (The Morn­ing Show) and Olivia Col­man (bi­o­graph­i­cal drama The Crown).</p>
    <p>Zen­daya, who plays Rue in the se­ries that gained con­tro­versy for ad­dress­ing is­sues such as sex and drugs among high school­ers, is also among the record num­ber of black per­form­ers win­ning Em­mys this year.</p>
    <p>In what is be­ing hailed as a break­through for di­verse cast­ing, a record 11 black per­form­ers have won awards at the Cre­ative Arts and Primetime Em­mys.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Uzo Aduba (Sup­port­ing Ac­tress in a Lim­ited Se­ries for the bi­o­graph­i­cal Mrs Amer­ica), Yahya Ab­dul-Ma­teen II (Sup­port­ing Ac­tor in a Lim­ited Se­ries for Watch­men), Regina King (Lead Ac­tress i n a Lim­ited Se­ries for Watch­men) and RuPaul (Out­stand­ing Re­al­ity Se­ries).</p>
