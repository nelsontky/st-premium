    <p>Sin­ga­pore will work on se­cur­ing a port­fo­lio of Covid-19 vac­cines to cater to dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion in­stead of re­ly­ing on one vac­cine, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He also said ne­go­ti­a­tions with Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Pfizer and var­i­ous oth­ers that are con­duct­ing clin­i­cal tri­als on vac­cines are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Given the ex­pected global de­mand, di­ver­si­fy­ing Sin­ga­pore’s vac­cine port­fo­lio will im­prove its chances of se­cur­ing a suit­able vac­cine, he said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence by the Multi-min­istry Task­force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>De­tails on which vac­cines will make the list and which seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion will re­ceive a vac­cine are still be­ing worked out, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan noted that the Gov­ern­ment will have to take into ac­count vary­ing ef­fi­cacy and safety pro­files for dif­fer­ent groups when de­cid­ing how to vac­ci­nate the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, some vac­cines may not be ef­fec­tive for chil­dren and oth­ers may not be ef­fec­tive for se­niors, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan fur­ther said that even when vac­cines be­come avail­able, they will have to be given out pro­gres­sively as it is not pos­si­ble to vac­ci­nate the en­tire na­tion at once.</p>
    <p>Depend­ing on the na­ture of the vac­cine, Sin­ga­pore may de­cide not to vac­ci­nate all its cit­i­zens, he added.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers fight­ing the virus on the front lines will likely get first pri­or­ity, fol­lowed by vul­ner­a­ble groups like se­niors who may de­velop more se­vere symp­toms as a re­sult of in­fec­tion, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak noted that one vac­cine can­di­date de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioN­Tech was re­cently found to be more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said that while this is wel­come news, more in­for­ma­tion about it as well as oth­ers that are close to fin­ish­ing phase three tri­als is needed.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if the vac­cines do not pro­vide long-last­ing im­mu­nity, a pa­tient may need re­peated vac­ci­na­tions in­stead of a sin­gle dose.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Mak noted that there are ef­forts to pro­mote lo­cal de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine as well. He cited an on­go­ing trial in­volv­ing a part­ner­ship be­tween Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics and Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School.</p>
    <p>“We are hope­ful that these stud­ies, these col­lab­o­ra­tions, will give us a suite of vac­cine can­di­dates that can pro­vide good re­sults for our pop­u­la­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said an ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion, set up last month, will as­sess the data com­ing out of the tri­als and ad­vise the min­istry on its vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy. “In the mean­time, it is im­por­tant to con­tinue to en­sure that our safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures or pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures are in place, and we con­tinue to ob­serve per­sonal hy­giene and so on,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“This will help re­duce the over­all in­fec­tion rate in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on the com­mit­tee, Prof Mak said its mem­bers come from dif­fer­ent sec­tors and agen­cies, in­clud­ing both aca­demic and clin­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>He said confidenti­al in­for­ma­tion ob­tained by the min­istry from dis­cus­sions with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies will be given to the com­mit­tee, sub­ject to a con­fi­den­tial­ity agree­ment, to help it con­duct a de­tailed re­view and make rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>More de­tails of the com­mit­tee’s mis­sion and com­po­si­tion will be re­leased soon, he added.</p>
    <p>His min­istry will be­gin ed­u­cat­ing peo­ple on the im­por­tance and ben­e­fits of vac­ci­na­tion so that they can make in­formed de­ci­sions on tak­ing part in vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts, he said.</p>
    <p>MUL­TI­PLE VAC­CINE CAN­DI­DATES</p>
    <p>We are hope­ful that these stud­ies, these col­lab­o­ra­tions, will give us a suite of vac­cine can­di­dates that can pro­vide good re­sults for our pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CI­ATE PRO­FES­SOR KEN­NETH MAK, the Min­istry of Health’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices, re­fer­ring to lo­cal ef­forts to de­velop a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, it is im­por­tant to con­tinue to en­sure that our safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures or pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures are in place, and we con­tinue to ob­serve per­sonal hy­giene and so on.</p>
