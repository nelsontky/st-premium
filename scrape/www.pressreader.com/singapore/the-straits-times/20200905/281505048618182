    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID) was of­fi­cially opened on Sept 7 last year.</p>
    <p>Barely four months later, we were at the fore­front of Sin­ga­pore’s out­break ef­forts when Covid-19 hit our shores as it swept over the globe.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore was among the first coun­tries in Asia to re­port a case af­ter China, it was im­per­a­tive for re­search here to guide how the dis­ease was man­aged and pre­vented.</p>
    <p>We would soon learn that this was a very un­usual virus, one full of sur­prises. We had to watch it closely as we learnt to deal with it ev­ery step of the way.</p>
    <p>We have fought back with three weapons: knowl­edge, flex­i­bil­ity and col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>KNOW YOUR EN­EMY</p>
    <p>Sars-CoV-2, the name of the virus that causes Covid-19, had never been seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>Re­search was ur­gently needed to un­der­stand how in­fec­tion could re­sult in short- and long-term dam­age to the body, how the im­mune sys­tem re­sponded and coped, and how ge­netic changes in the virus in­flu­enced the course of the dis­ease and the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>As this in­for­ma­tion was be­ing pieced to­gether, we also needed to en­sure that re­sources were al­lo­cated to com­bat the virus with­out com­pro­mis­ing ac­cess to care and treat­ment of other ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>Re­search was also needed to counter col­lat­eral dam­age aris­ing from the pan­demic, for ex­am­ple, to en­sure the pop­u­la­tion’s well-be­ing by build­ing up re­silience.</p>
    <p>NCID’s com­mu­nity-based co­hort study has been mon­i­tor­ing the pop­u­la­tion’s re­silience and the psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact and at­ti­tudes dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic through reg­u­lar sur­veys.</p>
    <p>Prepa­ra­tion was key.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing lessons from the 2003 se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) cri­sis, NCID started re­view­ing in-house stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures and brief­ing units on the im­pend­ing ar­rival of the virus.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory be­gan work­ing on lab­o­ra­tory de­tec­tion sys­tems, and the out­pa­tient clin­ics and emer­gency depart­ment be­gan screen­ing re­turn­ing trav­ellers sus­pected of be­ing in­fected.</p>
    <p>The first case in Sin­ga­pore was con­firmed on Jan 23.</p>
    <p>Just a day ear­lier, NCID had brought to­gether a group of re­searchers from all re­search in­sti­tutes and aca­demic cen­tres in the coun­try, in prepa­ra­tion for Case 1.</p>
    <p>As at end July, more than 500 Covid-19 pa­tients have been re­cruited for NCID’s in­ten­sive Pro­tect study, which de­tects novel pathogens and char­ac­terises emerg­ing in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>They formed the core of our re­search co­hort, al­low­ing us to study the im­pact of the virus from mul­ti­ple an­gles, from dis­ease man­i­fes­ta­tions and vi­ral shed­ding to im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>What we learnt from these pa­tients pro­vided the foun­da­tion for de­vel­op­ing di­ag­nos­tics and test­ing strate­gies, and mod­el­ling dis­ease and trans­mis­sion pat­terns.</p>
    <p>The early find­ings from lo­cal stud­ies, re­ported in rep­utable jour­nals, at­test to the high-qual­ity re­search made pos­si­ble by sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ment and ef­fort in the 17 years fol­low­ing the Sars out­break.</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent pan­demic, we re­ported higher vi­ral shed­ding at the early on­set of ill­ness – which means a per­son is in­fec­tious very early into the ill­ness, when symp­toms are mild.</p>
    <p>This was crit­i­cal ev­i­dence which guided pre­ven­tion strate­gies such as early test­ing and iso­la­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Our data also demon­strated clearly that older pa­tients fared</p>
    <p>When case def­i­ni­tions were changed with new in­for­ma­tion of epi­demi­o­log­i­cal links, work­flow changes had to be rolled out across the en­tire health­care set­ting...</p>
    <p>This was on top of the chal­lenge at NCID (Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases) of work­ing at new fa­cil­i­ties where staff had to nav­i­gate a com­plex build­ing de­signed to have clear seg­re­ga­tion of ma­te­ri­als and the flow of peo­ple, to avoid cross-con­tam­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>worse, so se­niors were urged to be ex­tra care­ful and avoid get­ting in­fected.</p>
    <p>The same data also told us who were at lower risk of com­pli­ca­tions, and in­formed poli­cies on pa­tients who could be safely cared for in com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Amid the flurry of test­ing drugs for Covid-19 and pres­sure from the com­mu­nity to trial un­proven ther­a­pies, our engagement with in­ter­na­tional part­ners paid off, as we were able to con­duct and par­tic­i­pate in ro­bust tri­als and were early adopters of novel ther­a­pies such as the an­tivi­ral drug Remde­sivir.</p>
    <p>At this stage, though, there re­main many unan­swered ques­tions.</p>
    <p>We expect Sars-CoV-2, like other RNA viruses, to mu­tate, but we do not know whether it will be­come more or less con­ta­gious, or more or less vir­u­lent.</p>
    <p>It also re­mains to be seen how long pa­tients have im­mu­nity af­ter in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>But with its head start in re­search, Sin­ga­pore is poised to take the lead in an­swer­ing these ques­tions.</p>
    <p>FLEX­I­BIL­ITY AMID A COM­PLEX, FLUID SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>In the early stages, when much about the virus was un­known, we had to ad­just rapidly and adapt to the evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion as we learnt about the virus on the fly.</p>
    <p>A small pol­icy tweak could trig­ger a whole chain of down­stream ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Rapid changes in how a sus­pected case was de­fined – guid­ing screen­ing and iso­la­tion pro­ce­dures – was one ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>As the num­ber of re­gions af­fected by Covid-19 and clin­i­cal fea­tures of the virus evolved, we had to im­ple­ment changes in our re­sponse.</p>
    <p>When case def­i­ni­tions were changed with new in­for­ma­tion of epi­demi­o­log­i­cal links, work­flow changes had to be rolled out across the en­tire health­care set­ting.</p>
    <p>These ranged from ini­tial as­sess­ment of pa­tients – such as con­tact and travel ques­tion­naires – to sub­se­quent down­stream chains, in­clud­ing triage, clin­i­cal as­sess­ment, tests, iso­la­tion pro­ce­dures and so on.</p>
    <p>This was on top of the chal­lenge at NCID of work­ing at new fa­cil­i­ties where staff had to nav­i­gate a com­plex build­ing de­signed to have clear seg­re­ga­tion of ma­te­ri­als and the flow of peo­ple, to avoid cross-con­tam­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In spite of this, the teams were able to adapt, and also dis­played ini­tia­tive in seek­ing solutions as new chal­lenges arose when we had to deal with large com­mu­nity clus­ters.</p>
    <p>They were able to do so be­cause they felt safe at work – they were well trained, had ad­e­quate per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, and ro­bust in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures were in place.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing those brought in from other in­sti­tu­tions to boost man­power, was united with the com­mon pur­pose of giv­ing pa­tients the best treat­ment and stem­ming the out­break in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>WORK­ING TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>Col­lab­o­ra­tion took place across in­sti­tu­tions, as well as on the ground.</p>
    <p>To op­er­ate NCID at the full ca­pac­ity of 586 beds – four times its reg­u­lar vol­ume – ad­di­tional man­power and other re­sources were needed.</p>
    <p>Much man­power and ex­per­tise came from nearby Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The neona­tal-pae­di­atric work group (from NCID, KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal and the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal), which was set up be­fore the pan­demic, was also put into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Work­flows were for­mu­lated and im­ple­mented be­tween mul­ti­ple par­ties within a com­pressed pe­riod to en­sure safety and op­ti­mal pa­tient care.</p>
    <p>The NCID in­ten­sive care unit re­ceived well-qual­i­fied nurses from other pub­lic hos­pi­tals, and ex­tra­cor­po­real mem­brane oxy­gena­tion (ECMO) teams from SingHealth’s Na­tional Heart Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore and the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem were mo­bilised to sup­port ECMO work at NCID.</p>
    <p>The ECMO ma­chine takes over the role of a dis­eased lung and ar­ti­fi­cially oxy­genates the blood out­side the body.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate and com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals, and later, com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties helmed by pub­lic and pri­vate health­care in­sti­tu­tions and the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces, added much­needed bed space and strength to house and man­age more cases.</p>
    <p>These col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­forts at­test to the co­he­sive­ness of the lo­cal health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>NCID stands ready to work with part­ners from the Gov­ern­ment, pri­vate sec­tor, vol­un­tary wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tions as well as the pub­lic to do our part.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre hopes to do more in terms of com­mu­nity engagement by as­sess­ing the Covid-19 risk level of di­verse in­di­vid­u­als, es­pe­cially in multi-gen­er­a­tional fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The virus is forc­ing us to change and adapt.</p>
    <p>One good thing that has come out of it is new at­ten­tion to good hy­giene prac­tices, in­clud­ing mask­ing up and keep­ing our pri­vate and pub­lic en­vi­ron­ment clean.</p>
    <p>But when it comes to beat­ing this health cri­sis, the road ahead is a long one.</p>
    <p>As NCID turns one next Mon­day, we are tak­ing a mo­ment dur­ing this re­prieve – pro­vided by lower com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in Sin­ga­pore – to re­flect and plan, so that we can stay ahead of the virus.</p>
