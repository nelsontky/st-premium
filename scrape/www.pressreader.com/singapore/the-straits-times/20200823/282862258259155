    <p>Mr An­drew D. Hendry rose through the cor­po­rate ranks to be­come the vice-chair­man and gen­eral coun­sel for Col­gate-Pal­mo­live, the global con­sumer prod­ucts com­pany.</p>
    <p>As a lawyer, he un­der­stood com­pli­cated le­gal doc­u­ments and how they guided the in­ner work­ings of a large cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>But when it came to his es­tate plan, like many oth­ers, he was not ter­ri­bly in­ter­ested in dig­ging through hun­dreds of pages of le­gal papers.</p>
    <p>An es­tate plan is in­tended to dis­trib­ute our as­sets after our death. The task can some­times be too mun­dane or too macabre for many, and it is of­ten put off.</p>
    <p>When the coro­n­avirus cri­sis put mor­tal­ity front and cen­tre, Mr Hendry, 72, felt it was time to re­visit his plan. He found com­fort in what his wealth ad­viser had cre­ated: A series of colour-coded doc­u­ments that laid out ex­actly who got what, when and why.</p>
    <p>“The flow chart is the guid­ing doc­u­ment,” said Mr Hendry, who lives in Pine­hurst, North Carolina, with his wife, Mary.</p>
    <p>“I’m a lawyer, and I un­der­stand es­tate plan­ning doc­u­ments have to be pretty heavy for the es­tate plan to work. But they’re really not use­ful to make a de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>Neatly di­a­grammed flow charts and colour-coded spread­sheets are not what most peo­ple think of when they en­vi­sion the densely worded doc­u­ments that will carry out their last wishes.</p>
    <p>But the mor­tal­ity risk for older adults who con­tract the coro­n­avirus has pushed many peo­ple to call their lawyers and wealth ad­vis­ers to make sure their af­fairs are in order. Charts are much eas­ier to com­pre­hend than le­gal jar­gon.</p>
    <p>“More peo­ple are look­ing to re­view their es­tate plans if some­thing hap­pens, but it’s hard to keep track of ev­ery­thing with­out a sched­ule like this,” said Mr John J. Volt­ag­gio, a man­ag­ing wealth ad­viser at North­ern Trust who cre­ates colour­coded charts and sim­ple spread­sheets for his clients, in­clud­ing Mr Hendry.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cal colour-coded plans come in sev­eral sec­tions. A flow chart can be a sin­gle page. It starts with the to­tal as­sets, or es­tate value, at the top. When one spouse dies, if the es­tate is large enough, some amount flows into a trust and the rest flows to the sur­viv­ing spouse. When the sec­ond spouse dies, the flow chart can present op­tions, with more money flow­ing into a tax-ex­empt trust for heirs or go­ing to chil­dren out­right, to char­i­ties, to es­tate taxes or to friends and fam­ily as be­quests.</p>
    <p>A more de­tailed spread­sheet al­lows peo­ple to tweak how much is go­ing to each heir, and to see what the es­tate tax ram­i­fi­ca­tions are de­pend­ing on what as­sets are trans­ferred, how they’re trans­ferred and when they’re trans­ferred.</p>
    <p>Mr Hendry has a son but no grand­chil­dren. He has a sec­ond home in Amelia Is­land, Florida, and has var­i­ous char­i­ta­ble in­ter­ests. What he finds help­ful with the spread­sheet are the de­tailed fi­nan­cial val­ues be­fore and after taxes.</p>
    <p>Play­ing with the val­ues in the spread­sheet, like ad­just­ing risk ver­sus re­turn pref­er­ences in an in­vest­ment plan, al­lows him to see the con­se­quences of his de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“Putting it to­gether like that al­lows you to make a rea­son­able judg­ment,” he said. “You can stress test it and un­der­stand who ben­e­fits and what hap­pens when you make your de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>For peo­ple who are not trained lawyers, the charts can help them un­der­stand the plan and can serve as ver­i­fi­ca­tion that their de­sires will be ful­filled.</p>
    <p>“Our process is we sum­marise it, we vi­su­alise it, and we talk through it,” said Mr Joseph C. Kellogg, head of wealth plan­ning at WE Fam­ily Of­fices, which man­ages money for af­flu­ent fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The colour cod­ing serves as a way to make cer­tain points stand out. “If we spot it, we make sure fam­i­lies spot it, too,” he said.</p>
    <p>With in­vest­ments, for ex­am­ple, high­light­ing cer­tain ar­eas can draw a per­son’s at­ten­tion to who will be in charge of mak­ing in­vest­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion de­ci­sions for the es­tate.</p>
    <p>The “if/then” clauses that pop­u­late es­tate doc­u­ments can be more com­pli­cated. They’re meant to trig­ger an ac­tion if a set of cri­te­ria is met. One ex­am­ple would be more money go­ing to some­one if the value of a cer­tain as­set rose.</p>
    <p>You can tweak things in the chart, but your lawyer has to put the changes into your es­tate doc­u­ments for them to be ef­fec­tive. (This is where the ex­er­cise dif­fers from mak­ing ad­just­ments to in­vest­ments; your ad­viser can make those changes on the spot.)</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, Mr Hendry said, he, like any one else, just wanted the plan to work, both on pa­per now and in prac­tice later.</p>
    <p>“If I didn’t have this flow chart, I’m not sure what I would do,” he said. “I’m not go­ing to sit down and read 500 pages of doc­u­ments. By do­ing this, it gives my wife and me a sense of se­cu­rity that we have con­trol of this sit­u­a­tion and have it laid out as best we can.”</p>
