    <p>One of China’s lead­ing vac­cine de­vel­op­ers plans to in­oc­u­late stu­dents go­ing abroad with Covid-19 shots that have yet to get reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, said peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, as the coun­try pushes sci­en­tific bound­aries in the race for a vi­able vac­cine.</p>
    <p>China Na­tional Biotec Group (CNBG), a sub­sidiary of sta­te­owned Sinopharm Group, is in talks with the gov­ern­ment about giv­ing stu­dents headed abroad for stud­ies its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The two shots be­ing de­vel­oped by CNBG – which are in the final, third phase of test­ing – were au­tho­rised for emer­gency use in China and have been ad­min­is­tered to hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple, in­clud­ing med­i­cal work­ers and em­ploy­ees of state-owned firms work­ing in high-risk coun­tries. Stu­dents would rep­re­sent an un­prece­dented ex­pan­sion in the use of vac­cines that have not com­pleted full hu­man test­ing, though the Chi­nese reg­u­la­tor can de­ter­mine that the group can come un­der the re­mit of emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>“While ob­vi­ously very im­por­tant to the fam­i­lies and stu­dents in­volved, study­ing abroad is not an emer­gency – no lives are at threat here,” Pro­fes­sor Nigel McMil­lan, direc­tor of the in­fec­tious diseases and im­munol­ogy pro­gramme at Griffith Univer­sity’s Men­zies Health In­sti­tute Queens­land, said.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent con­cern about leav­ing China – where the pathogen has been nearly erad­i­cated through ag­gres­sive con­tain­ment mea­sures – for for­eign coun­tries, where Covid-19 is still spread­ing rapidly, prompted the dis­cus­sions, the peo­ple said. In­fec­tions in the United States and Europe are re-surg­ing.</p>
    <p>CNBG ap­pears to be gaug­ing in­ter­est among the public for its vac­cine can­di­dates, with a link on its web­site let­ting peo­ple ap­ply to get a shot. More than 154,000 peo­ple had reg­is­tered, and a notice said stu­dents go­ing over­seas could get the vac­cines for free.</p>
