    <p>LON­DON • The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is set to hand more than £40 bil­lion (S$71 bil­lion) to com­pa­nies that can help in its drive to ramp up mass coro­n­avirus test­ing.</p>
    <p>Public Health Eng­land put a £22 bil­lion con­tract to ten­der last week for a new “na­tional mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy frame­work agree­ment” that in­cludes the man­u­fac­ture and de­vel­op­ment of tests for two years, with the op­tion to ex­tend for an­other two years.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate £20 bil­lion ten­der from the Na­tional Health Ser­vice Sup­ply Chain in­volves on-the-spot tests and di­ag­nos­tic equip­ment, while a third ten­der worth £912 mil­lion cov­ers the sup­ply of rapid turn­around lat­eral flow tests.</p>
    <p>The to­tal scale of the con­tracts – big­ger than the an­nual bud­gets of some gov­ern­ment de­part­ments – was re­vealed by the Fi­nan­cial Times on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“As part of an un­prece­dented re­sponse to this global pan­demic, we have drawn on the ex­per­tise and re­sources of a num­ber of public and pri­vate sec­tor part­ners to sup­port our test­ing pro­gramme,” a Depart­ment of Health and So­cial Care spokesman said, adding that the to­tal rep­re­sented the con­tracts’ max­i­mum value.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son in Septem­ber spoke of his hopes for mil­lions of Covid-19 tests to be pro­cessed daily in a bid to help Bri­tain re­turn to nor­mal life as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool in north-west Eng­land be­came the first city to un­der­take a mass test­ing pro­gramme l ast week, and the gov­ern­ment said on Tues­day that this could be rolled out to 66 other lo­cal ar­eas.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey pub­lished yes­ter­day found that al­most two-thirds of peo­ple in Bri­tain said they would get vac­ci­nated for Covid-19, but that young peo­ple are far more likely to refuse a jab.</p>
    <p>The poll, by public opin­ion re­search firm Kan­tar, showed 22 per cent of re­spon­dents said they would def­i­nitely not or prob­a­bly not get a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Th­ese re­spon­dents com­prised 38 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds, while only 5 per cent of those aged 65 and over and 16 per cent of those aged 55 to 64 said they would def­i­nitely not or prob­a­bly not get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Matt Han­cock said on Tues­day that vac­ci­na­tions for Covid-19 will be op­tional in Bri­tain.</p>
