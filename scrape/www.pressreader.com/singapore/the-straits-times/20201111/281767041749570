    <p>BEI­JING China is dou­bling down on ef­forts to stem the trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus through im­ported cold prod­ucts, re­quir­ing thor­ough dis­in­fec­tion of such ship­ments be­fore they come into con­tact with do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>The height­ened pre­cau­tions were an­nounced in a no­tice re­leased by the State Coun­cil’s Joint Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol Mech­a­nism on Mon­day, af­ter Tian­jin re­ported a con­firmed case of Covid-19 – a worker at a lo­cal frozen food com­pany – on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>A string of do­mes­tic in­fec­tion clus­ters this year have been linked to cold-chain im­ported food.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ment, sell­ers of cold-chain im­ported food must present dis­in­fec­tion cer­tifi­cates be­fore their prod­ucts are al­lowed to en­ter the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In or­der to re­duce dis­rup­tion to nor­mal lo­gis­tics and sup­plies, dis­in­fec­tion should be car­ried out af­ter nu­cleic acid sam­ples from overseas prod­ucts are col­lected, and should be con­ducted only once in most cases, it says.</p>
    <p>“Dis­in­fec­tion ser­vice providers should record their work in de­tail and the records and pa­per­work should be kept for at least two years,” the doc­u­ment adds.</p>
    <p>It also stresses im­prov­ing the ca­pa­bil­ity of trac­ing the ori­gin and flow of cold-stor­age prod­ucts and in­ves­ti­gat­ing and hold­ing ship­ments from un­spec­i­fied sources.</p>
    <p>“The goal is to be safe, ef­fi­cient, speedy and eco­nom­i­cal,” it says. “While en­sur­ing the safety of im­ported cold prod­ucts, we are also aim­ing to in­crease ef­fi­ciency dur­ing cus­toms clear­ance, avoid back­logs and se­cure the sta­bil­ity of the in­dus­try chain.”</p>
    <p>Global ex­perts have long sus­pected the virus’ abil­ity to travel and be trans­mit­ted through cold­chain prod­ucts, but ev­i­dence has not been easy to nail down.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese main­land has de­tected at least 16 cases in­volv­ing frozen im­ports test­ing pos­i­tive for the pres­ence of the coro­n­avirus since July.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Cus­toms of­fi­cials yes­ter­day said they had sus­pended im­ports from In­done­sia’s Anu­grah</p>
    <p>Laut In­done­sia for one week, af­ter the virus was de­tected in a sam­ple of frozen fish prod­ucts supplied by the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) said it had iso­lated liv­ing coro­n­avirus on the outer pack­ag­ing of frozen food when in­ves­ti­gat­ing the source of an out­break in Qing­dao, Shan­dong province. The dis­cov­ery, a world first, proved that con­tact with frozen food pack­ag­ing con­tam­i­nated by live virus could cause in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Later that month, a Chi­nese re­search team con­sist­ing of univer­sity re­searchers and CDC ex­perts con­cluded from epi­demi­o­log­i­cal his­tory and data anal­y­sis that the out­break that took place in Bei­jing in June was likely to have been trig­gered by im­ported seafood, and that cold-chain trans­porta­tion could be a new route of trans­mis­sion for the virus.</p>
    <p>The con­firmed pa­tient in Tian­jin is a load­ing dock worker who han­dled frozen pork from Ger­many that ar­rived in Tian­jin on Oct 19. The ship­ment, part of which was sent to Shan­dong, tested pos­i­tive for the virus last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Tian­jin gov­ern­ment said on Mon­day evening that it had found a new asymp­to­matic pa­tient ear­lier in the day – a truck driver who lugged goods from a frozen stor­age clus­ter in the city’s Bin­hai New Area last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Tian­jin Health Com­mis­sion deputy direc­tor Gu Qing said two ar­eas in the Bin­hai New Area would be clas­si­fied as a medi­um­risk re­gion from mid­night on Mon­day. Other parts of the city re­mained at low-risk.</p>
