    <p>A Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) of­fi­cer has been slapped with an 18-month jail term for switch­ing urine sam­ples at Wood­lands Check­point to let a sus­pect off the hook so that he could avoid the pa­per­work needed to charge the man with a drug of­fence.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Hafiz Lan, 41, a staff sergeant, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day af­ter he pleaded guilty to a charge of in­ten­tion­ally ob­struct­ing the course of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>His al­leged co-con­spir­a­tors, Muham­mad Zuhairi Zain­uri, 31, a sergeant, and Ab­dul Rah­man Kadir, 43, a staff sergeant, have been charged with the same of­fence and will be dealt with at a later date. All three of­fi­cers have been sus­pended since July last year.</p>
    <p>They were work­ing at Wood­lands Check­point late at night on Aug 15, 2018, when they en­coun­tered Maung Moe Min Oo, a 32-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who was re­ferred to them for fur­ther drug test­ing as a swab test showed he had con­sumed drugs. Sub­se­quent in­ves­ti­ga­tions have since re­vealed that Maung had in­deed taken drugs be­fore at­tempt­ing to en­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Know­ing he was un­likely to pass the urine test, Maung not only de­clined to give a urine sam­ple but also sought le­niency from the of­fi­cers. The trio al­legedly hatched a plan early in the morn­ing of Aug 16, 2018, to give Maung a “se­cond chance” – by switch­ing his sam­ple with one of their own, so he could pass the drug test.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the of­fi­cers did so be­cause they knew the process of ob­tain­ing a sam­ple from Maung could take some time, and switch­ing his urine sam­ple with a clean one could ex­pe­dite the pro­cess­ing of his de­par­ture from the CNB of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Hafiz col­lected his own urine sam­ple and hid it in a cu­bi­cle in a toi­let at the check­point. When he took Maung to the toi­let on the pre­text of col­lect­ing his urine sam­ple, he told him where to find the clean sam­ple. He also gave Maung de­tailed in­struc­tions on how to pass the sam­ple off as his own. Maung passed the drug test and was al­lowed to en­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The mis­deeds came to light when Maung left Sin­ga­pore and tried to re-en­ter the coun­try the next day. He was de­tained again for sus­pected drug con­sump­tion by a dif­fer­ent CNB team. He then re­vealed to them that CNB of­fi­cers had helped him pass his in­stant urine test the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors (DPPs) Navin Naidu and Thi­agesh Suku­maran said a heav­ier sen­tence was war­ranted, cit­ing the ex­ten­sive plan­ning and pre­med­i­ta­tion. They also asked for a de­ter­rent sen­tence to re­flect the grav­ity of the of­fence.</p>
    <p>“When a law en­force­ment of­fi­cer com­mits an of­fence in the course of his du­ties, an up­lift in sen­tence is im­posed ir­re­spec­tive of the of­fender’s mo­tive, be it fi­nan­cial gain or plain lazi­ness,” said DPP Naidu.</p>
