    <p>Ms Parti Liyani was ac­cused of steal­ing a $1,000 Pi­o­neer DVD player and two Longchamp bags worth about $200 each from Mr Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>In her de­fence, Ms Parti said that in 2012 or 2013, Mr Liew’s wife, Madam Ng Lai Peng, wanted to throw the DVD player away be­cause it was bro­ken, but agreed to let her take it back to In­done­sia to fix.</p>
    <p>Madam Ng said in court, how­ever, that the DVD player was not bro­ken. At the trial, it was shown that the de­vice could play a video dig­i­tally stored in the hard disk. How­ever, a demon­stra­tion at the ap­peal showed that when a DVD was in­serted into the player, the er­ror mes­sage “could not ini­tialise disc” was dis­played.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn said a DVD player that is un­able to play a DVD can rea­son­ably be de­scribed as “spoilt”. He found it likely that the Liews no longer wanted the “par­tially spoilt” player.</p>
    <p>As for the bags, Ms Parti said she had found them “near the rub­bish bin” at a neigh­bour’s house at the end of 2010.</p>
    <p>In con­tra­dic­tion, Mr Liew said in court he had bought the bags, but when pressed for de­tails, could not re­call when or where he had bought them.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan found Mr Liew’s ev­i­dence on own­er­ship to be “lack­ing” as he could not specif­i­cally and pos­i­tively iden­tify the par­tic­u­lar bags al­leged to be stolen.</p>
