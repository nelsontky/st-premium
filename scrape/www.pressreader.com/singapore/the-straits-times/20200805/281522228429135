    <p>SEOUL • The long­est spell of mon­soon rain South Korea has ex­pe­ri­enced i n seven years trig­gered floods that have forced over 1,000 peo­ple to flee their homes and killed at least 13 peo­ple in land­slides, as well as swept away cars, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain, which has also bat­tered China, Thai­land, Myan­mar and In­dia in re­cent days, in­un­dated farm­land and flooded parts of high­ways and bridges in Seoul.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in ex­pressed con­cern for public work­ers bat­tling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic af­ter 42 days of rain, which weather of­fi­cials said was the l ongest such stretch since 2013.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon urged all-out ef­forts by na­tional and re­gional au­thor­i­ties to pre­vent fur­ther loss of life, such as mea­sures to avert land­slides and evac­u­ate peo­ple, even in cases of lit­tle ap­par­ent dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Most of the flooded roads and bridges along the Han River in cen­tral Seoul that had backed up traf­fic and dam­aged in­fra­struc­ture were back in op­er­a­tion yes­ter­day, the South’s Yon­hap news agency said.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing North Korea, state me­dia warned of pos­si­ble flood­ing, say­ing some ar­eas were also ex­pe­ri­enc­ing heavy rain­fall.</p>
    <p>“All the sec­tors of the na­tional econ­omy, in­clud­ing the agri­cul­tural sec­tor, are tak­ing steps to pre­vent dam­age from the down­pour,” the North’s state news agency KCNA re­ported yes­ter­day, say­ing that some ar­eas were pre­dicted to get as much as half a me­tre of rain.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing uniden­ti­fied South Korean gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, Yon­hap said North Korea opened the flood­gates of a bor­der dam on Mon­day with­out ad­vance no­tice to its neighbour.</p>
    <p>Hagupit, the fourth ty­phoon of the year, landed in eastern China’s Zhe­jiang prov­ince in the wee hours of yes­ter­day, the Na­tional Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>Ty­phoon Hagupit landed on the coastal ar­eas of Yue­qing city un­der Wen­zhou at around 3.30am.</p>
    <p>It brought tor­ren­tial rain to Zhe­jiang and Fu­jian prov­inces. By 10pm on Mon­day, Zhe­jiang had evac­u­ated over 380,000 peo­ple. Some train ser­vices and con­struc­tion work in Fu­jian were halted.</p>
    <p>The me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal cen­tre fore­cast that the ty­phoon will track north and pass through Zhe­jiang, with its in­ten­sity grad­u­ally weak­en­ing. It was ex­pected to leave Zhe­jiang last night and en­ter the west­ern Yel­low Sea via north­ern Jiangsu to­day, be­fore mov­ing to­wards the west­ern coast of the Korean penin­sula.</p>
