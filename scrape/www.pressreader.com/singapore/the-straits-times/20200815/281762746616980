    <p>• Viet­nam has reg­is­tered to buy a Rus­sian Covid-19 vac­cine, state tele­vi­sion re­ported yes­ter­day, as it fights a new out­break after go­ing sev­eral months with no lo­cal cases.</p>
    <p>“In the mean­time, Viet­nam will still con­tinue de­vel­op­ing the coun­try’s own Covid-19 vac­cine,” state broad­caster Viet­nam Tele­vi­sion (VTV) said, cit­ing the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia said on Wed­nes­day that it would roll out the world’s first Covid-19 vac­cine within two weeks, re­ject­ing the con­cerns of ex­perts who said that it should not have been ap­proved be­fore com­plet­ing large-scale tri­als.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has signed up for 50 mil­lion to 150 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine, the Tuoi Tre news­pa­per re­ported. Some of it will be a “do­na­tion” from Rus­sia, Tuoi Tre said, with Viet­nam pay­ing for the rest. The Health Min­istry did not say when it ex­pected to re­ceive the vac­cine, or how much it would cost.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam was lauded for sup­press­ing an ear­lier out­break through ag­gres­sive test­ing, con­tact trac­ing and quar­an­tine, but it is now rac­ing to con­trol in­fec­tions in mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions linked to the pop­u­lar tourist city of Danang, where a new out­break was de­tected on July 25.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has re­ported a to­tal of 911 in­fec­tions, with 21 deaths. Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc has said the risk of wider con­ta­gion is very high, and that the next few days are crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day it had reached a deal with Bri­tish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm As­traZeneca for the pur­chase of at least 300 mil­lion doses of its po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s ex­ec­u­tive arm, which is ne­go­ti­at­ing on be­half of the 27 EU states, said the deal in­cluded an op­tion to pur­chase 100 mil­lion ad­di­tional doses should the vac­cine prove safe and ef­fec­tive. The agree­ment marks the EU’s first ad­vance pur­chase deal for a po­ten­tial vac­cine against the new coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>“To­day, after weeks of ne­go­ti­a­tions, we have the first EU ad­vance pur­chase agree­ment for a vac­cine can­di­date,” EU Health Com­mis­sioner Stella Kyr­i­akides said in a state­ment. On Thurs­day, the EU said it had re­served up to 400 mil­lion doses of a vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by US giant John­son & John­son.</p>
