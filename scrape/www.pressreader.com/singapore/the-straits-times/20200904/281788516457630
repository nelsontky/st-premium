    <p>PARIS • Asia has reg­is­tered more than 100,000 deaths linked to the coro­n­avirus since it first emerged in De­cem­ber, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse tally based on of­fi­cial sources yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 100,667 deaths have been at­trib­uted to the coro­n­avirus in the re­gion out of 5,420,803 of­fi­cially de­clared cases, with 4,255,760 peo­ple con­sid­ered to have re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>In terms of fa­tal­i­ties, In­dia is the most af­fected coun­try with nearly three-quar­ters of to­tal deaths in the re­gion – 67,376 deaths 3,853,406 cases.</p>
    <p>It is fol­lowed by In­done­sia with 7,750 deaths from 184,268 cases and Pak­istan with 6,328 deaths from 297,014 cases.</p>
    <p>The con­ti­nent, which had suc­cess­fully con­tained the virus af­ter its dis­cov­ery in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan in De­cem­ber, has faced an in­crease in the daily num­ber of cases and deaths since last month.</p>
    <p>Nearly 90,000 in­fec­tions and 1,200 fa­tal­i­ties have been re­ported on av­er­age ev­ery day for the past from week. This rep­re­sents an 11 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of cases and a 6 per cent rise in the num­ber of deaths over the previous week.</p>
    <p>The re­gion also had the most cases in one week at 618,000 and the sec­ond high­est num­ber of deaths at 8,600, a fig­ure topped only by Latin Amer­ica, which still records more than 16,000 deaths weekly.</p>
    <p>As well as be­ing the worst-hit coun­try in Asia, In­dia has also re­ported the big­gest surge in the world in a week, with more than half a mil­lion new cases (up 15 per cent in seven days) and more than 6,800 new deaths (up 5 per cent).</p>
    <p>In terms of deaths, Asia is the fourth most af­fected re­gion in the world, be­hind Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean (82,979 deaths, 7,514,473 cases); Europe (216,596 deaths, 4,049,902 cases); and the United States and Canada (194,915 deaths, 6,244,459 cases).</p>
    <p>It is ahead of the Mid­dle East (37,004 deaths, 1,524,773 cases), Africa (30,260 deaths, 1,267,343 cases) and Ocea­nia (707 deaths, 29,320 cases).</p>
