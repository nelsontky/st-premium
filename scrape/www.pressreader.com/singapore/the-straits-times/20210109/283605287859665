    <p>Tech­nol­ogy has played a sig­nif­i­cant role in tack­ling the global chal­lenges posed by the Covid-19 pan­demic. Hop­ing to build on that is young in­no­va­tor Joshua Chin, who wants to de­velop tech­nol­ogy-driven so­lu­tions to grow a more so­cially re­spon­si­ble so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“Tech­nol­ogy has greatly en­abled us in our ef­forts to fight against the coro­n­avirus. Thanks to these in­no­va­tions, we’re able to lead a life closer to nor­malcy, with­out need­ing to com­pro­mise on health and safety,” says the 20-year-old.</p>
    <p>A re­cip­i­ent of the Smart Na­tion Schol­ar­ship, Mr Chin is grate­ful for the op­por­tu­nity to pur­sue a ca­reer in the ever-chang­ing sec­tor of tech­nol­ogy. He strongly be­lieves in “serv­ing the public” and “mak­ing an im­pact” on the lives of oth­ers through tech­nol­ogy — and it was per­haps this con­vic­tion that scored him the cov­eted schol­ar­ship from the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency (GovTech).</p>
    <p>He says: “Tech­nol­ogy is con­stantly evolv­ing, and even more ex­cit­ing times lie ahead as new tech­nolo­gies emerge. Working in the field of com­puter sci­ence will</p>
    <p>I feel that I have a part in shap­ing the fu­ture by build­ing so­lu­tions that will con­trib­ute to how tech­nol­ogy is used in our so­ci­ety. Mr Joshua Chin, Smart Na­tion Schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ent</p>
    <p>put me right at the cen­tre of all these ex­cit­ing de­vel­op­ments.”</p>
    <p>De­cod­ing his true pas­sion</p>
    <p>At the start, Mr Chin had lit­tle in­ter­est in tech, let alone cod­ing. In­stead, he was fas­ci­nated with avi­a­tion, and would read about air­planes and watch avi­a­tion doc­u­men­taries, even when he was in pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>In sec­ondary school, he was part of the In­te­grated Pro­gramme where he was given the op­por­tu­nity to join the Sin­ga­pore Youth Fly­ing Club. Al­though he ini­tially con­sid­ered spe­cial­is­ing in aero­space en­gi­neer­ing, he de­cided to pur­sue a dif­fer­ent ca­reer path that would al­low him to “fo­cus on de­vel­op­ing my tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise”.</p>
    <p>This led him to in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, and with en­cour­age­ment from his fa­ther, Mr Chin be­gan to dab­ble in pro­gram­ming while serv­ing his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>He started out by solv­ing cod­ing puz­zles on­line, and even built his own Sudoku game as a fun chal­lenge while learn­ing to code.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore I knew it, I was sucked into it and just kept want­ing to learn more,” he says. “Be­yond pro­gram­ming, I was also in­ter­ested in the other top­ics that would be taught in a com­puter sci­ence course, such as dis­crete math­e­mat­ics, data struc­tures and al­go­rithms.”</p>
    <p>Shap­ing the dig­i­tal fu­ture</p>
    <p>Mr Chin will pur­sue a Bach­e­lor of Arts in com­puter sci­ence at the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge late this year. Till then, he plans to take up an in­tern­ship at GovTech, while mak­ing use of his free time to learn about var­i­ous re­lated fields such as cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Upon grad­u­a­tion, he will serve a six-year bond with GovTech. Aside from the at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, train­ing cour­ses and men­tor­ship pro­grammes, he looks for­ward to con­tribut­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s Smart Na­tion drive.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited to work on projects that would even­tu­ally be de­ployed to help ci­ti­zens, civil ser­vants and busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore, be it through build­ing soft­ware and ap­pli­ca­tions, or en­sur­ing that gov­ern­ment ser­vices re­main safe from cy­ber at­tacks and se­cu­rity breaches,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I feel that I have a part in shap­ing the fu­ture by build­ing so­lu­tions that will con­trib­ute to how tech­nol­ogy is used in our so­ci­ety. Al­though the process may not be easy, do­ing so at GovTech will def­i­nitely make each ex­pe­ri­ence mean­ing­ful and mem­o­rable.”</p>
