    <p>Close to US$4 mil­lion (S$5.3 mil­lion) in il­licit funds linked to a group that pro­vided en­crypted telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion de­vices and net­work ser­vices used by transna­tional or­gan­ised crim­i­nal syn­di­cates has been seized in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>About US$3.97 mil­lion was seized from four bank ac­counts here by the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) and the US au­thor­i­ties, the United States De­part­ment of Jus­tice (DOJ) said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The funds be­longed to Phan­tom Secure, an en­crypted telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­work used by transna­tional or­gan­ised crim­i­nal syn­di­cates. The amount has been repa­tri­ated to the US, ac­cord­ing to an­nounce­ments from the At­tor­ney’s Of­fice for the South­ern District of Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The seizure of the funds fol­lows the in­dict­ment of Vin­cent Ramos, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Canad­abased Phan­tom Secure, and four of his as­so­ci­ates, by a US fed­eral grand jury in March 2018.</p>
    <p>The five were ac­cused of op­er­at­ing a crim­i­nal en­ter­prise that fa­cil­i­tated the transna­tional im­por­ta­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of nar­cotics through the sale and ser­vice of en­crypted telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions de­vices and ser­vices to drug traf­fick­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Phan­tom Secure had ad­ver­tised that its “un­crack­able” phones were im­per­vi­ous to de­cryp­tion, wire­tap­ping or le­gal third-party records re­quests. It also pro­vided a ser­vice to guar­an­tee the de­struc­tion of ev­i­dence con­tained in the de­vice if it were ever com­pro­mised by an in­for­mant, or if law en­force­ment ac­quired it.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Ramos pleaded guilty to lead­ing a crim­i­nal en­ter­prise that fa­cil­i­tated the transna­tional im­por­ta­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of nar­cotics in­clud­ing co­caine, heroin and metham­phetamine to the US through the sale of these en­crypted de­vices.</p>
    <p>Ramos was sen­tenced to 108 months in pri­son, and the Phan­tom Secure net­work has been shut down.</p>
    <p>As part of his guilty plea, Ramos agreed to an US$80 mil­lion for­fei­ture money judg­ment. He also agreed to give up tens of mil­lions of dol­lars in iden­ti­fied as­sets in bank ac­counts world­wide, as well as houses, a Lam­borgh­ini, cryp­tocur­rency ac­counts and gold coins. The money repa­tri­ated from Sin­ga­pore was among the as­sets iden­ti­fied by in­ves­ti­ga­tors to be for­feited.</p>
    <p>The DOJ said Ramos’ cus­tomers used his prod­ucts to dev­as­tat­ing and some­times deadly ef­fect. For in­stance, a 2014 Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion news ar­ti­cle re­ported that in­ves­ti­ga­tions into a gang­land mur­der in Syd­ney were stymied be­cause the sus­pects used Phan­tom Secure de­vices to co­or­di­nate the killing.</p>
    <p>Ramos had used this news to mar­ket his en­cryp­tion ser­vices to crim­i­nals across the world, writ­ing: “This is the best ver­i­fi­ca­tion on what we have been say­ing all along – proven and ef­fec­tive for now over nine years. It is the high­est level of author­ity con­firm­ing our ef­fec­tive­ness. It can’t get bet­ter than that.”</p>
    <p>The DOJ said it had worked closely with Sin­ga­pore’s CAD since 2018 to iden­tify and seize the funds linked to the sale of Phan­tom Secure de­vices. It com­mended the ef­forts of its Sin­ga­pore coun­ter­parts in iden­ti­fy­ing, freez­ing and repa­tri­at­ing pro­ceeds of Ramos’ crim­i­nal en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>Ms Suzanne Turner, spe­cial agent in charge at the US Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, said: “The repa­tri­a­tion of close to US$4 mil­lion by our Sin­ga­pore-based part­ners en­sures that Vin­cent Ramos and the lead­ers of Phan­tom Secure will pay for their crimes.”</p>
