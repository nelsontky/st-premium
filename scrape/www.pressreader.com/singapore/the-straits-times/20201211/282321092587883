    <p>SHANG­HAI S&P Dow Jones In­dices (DJI) said yes­ter­day it would re­move Chi­nese com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Hikvi­sion, from its products, be­com­ing the lat­est in­dex provider to do so fol­low­ing a Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion or­der re­strict­ing purchases of their shares.</p>
    <p>S&P DJI said it would re­move Ashares, H-shares and Amer­i­can de­posi­tary re­ceipts of 10 com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Hikvi­sion and Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp (SMIC), from all eq­uity in­dexes prior to the mar­ket open­ing on Dec 21.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it will also re­move 11 se­cu­ri­ties is­sued by Chi­nese com­pa­nies from its fixed in­come in­dexes be­fore Jan 1.</p>
    <p>Hikvi­sion and SMIC did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>“The or­der... may im­pact the abil­ity of mar­ket par­tic­i­pants to repli­cate S&P DJI eq­uity and fixed in­come in­dexes con­tain­ing se­cu­ri­ties af­fected by the or­der,” S&P DJI said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mit­subishi UFJ Koku­sai As­set Man­age­ment chief fund man­ager Kiyoshi Ishi­gane said that funds fol­low­ing the S&P in­dexes “will have to sell. This goes be­yond the rou­tine an­nual changes to names on the in­dex”.</p>
    <p>“Once the pas­sive funds start sell­ing, the ac­tive funds will be in­clined to do the same.”</p>
    <p>S&P DJI’s move comes after in­dex provider FTSE Rus­sell said last week that it would re­move eight Chi­nese firms from its products to com­ply with the US ex­ec­u­tive or­der, which barred US in­vestors from buy­ing se­cu­ri­ties of black­listed firms start­ing next Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it had acted on feed­back from in­dex sub­scribers and other stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive or­der, un­veiled last month and first re­ported by Reuters, is de­signed to de­ter US in­vest­ment firms, pen­sion funds and oth­ers from buy­ing shares of Chi­nese com­pa­nies des­ig­nated by the De­fence Depart­ment as backed by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Hikvi­sion pre­vi­ously said that the US or­der’s de­ci­sion to pur­sue it was “ground­less”. Hikvi­sion shares in Shen­zhen gained more than 4 per cent in early af­ter­noon trade yes­ter­day after the S&P DJI an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>SMIC’s Shang­hai shares rose 1.01 per cent and its H-shares fell 0.45 per cent in Hong Kong.</p>
