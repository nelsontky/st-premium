    <p>1 SAINTS FIR­ING ON ALL CYLIN­DERS</p>
    <p>Southampto­n have en­tered the top four on the back of some as­sured per­for­mances this term. Their 3-0 vic­tory over Sh­effield United was their sev­enth win from 12 games so far.</p>
    <p>Their 9-0 thrashing by Le­ices­ter some 14 months ago has all but been ban­ished from mem­ory, with man­ager Ralph Hasen­huttl build­ing a strong team iden­tity since tak­ing over in De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>2 PALACE MORE THAN A ONE-MAN TEAM</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, it seemed Crys­tal Palace were overly re­liant on Wil­fried Zaha to pro­vide their at­tack­ing spark but in Eberechi Eze, they have a new threat.</p>
    <p>The £17 mil­lion (S$30.4 mil­lion) sum­mer sign­ing from Queens Park Rangers is prov­ing to be a bar­gain and if he main­tains his form, the Eng­land Un­der-21 in­ter­na­tional can ex­pect to earn a se­nior cap.</p>
    <p>3 LE­ICES­TER CLOSE IN ON THE LEAD­ERS</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter nar­rowly missed out on a top-four fin­ish last sea­son but if their start to the 2020-2021 cam­paign is any­thing to go by, they will be in con­tention again.</p>
    <p>Jamie Vardy net­ted his 10th league goal and with James Maddison also grab­bing a brace against Brighton, their key play­ers are all in form.</p>
