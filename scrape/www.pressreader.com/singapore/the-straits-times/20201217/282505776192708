    <p>GIAN­NIS AN­TE­TOK­OUN­MPO’S NEW 5-YEAR BUCKS DEAL</p>
    <p>Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo has re­dou­bled his com­mit­ment to the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) af­ter ac­cept­ing a five-year con­tract ex­ten­sion worth an es­ti­mated US$228 mil­lion (S$303 mil­lion) from the Mil­wau­kee Bucks.</p>
    <p>Six days be­fore a Dec 21 dead­line to ei­ther sign the “su­per-max” ex­ten­sion or be­come an un­re­stricted free agent af­ter this sea­son, the “Greek Freak” re­leased a state­ment via his so­cial me­dia chan­nels on Tues­day, pro­claim­ing him­self “blessed to be able to be a part of the Mil­wau­kee Bucks for the next five years”.</p>
    <p>“This is my home, this is my city. Let’s make these years count. The show goes on, let’s get it,” An­te­tok­oun­mpo wrote.</p>
    <p>In a team state­ment con­firm­ing the deal, the NBA Most Valu­able Player (MVP) of the past two years said: “You took a chance on us eight years ago and now putting my sig­na­ture on a con­tract like this is un­real – but it’s all be­cause of hard work.</p>
    <p>“This is my home and I’m go­ing to con­tinue work­ing hard and do my best to make the Bucks, our fans and the city proud. Let’s have fun, win and make these years count.”</p>
    <p>The Bucks se­lected An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who was born and raised in Greece by Nige­rian par­ents, as the 15th over­all pick in the 2013 draft, de­spite his lim­ited ex­pe­ri­ence in the Greek sec­ond divi­sion.</p>
    <p>The for­ward has blos­somed be­yond all ex­pec­ta­tions and, by com­mit­ting his long-term fu­ture to the Bucks, has de­liv­ered the team one of their more sig­nif­i­cant vic­to­ries since Ka­reem Ab­dul-Jab­bar and Os­car Robert­son led Mil­wau­kee to their only NBA cham­pi­onship in 1971.</p>
    <p>“This is one of the great days in Bucks his­tory,” Peter Fei­gin, the Bucks’ team pres­i­dent, said dur­ing a vir­tual meet­ing or­gan­ised by the Mil­wau­kee Press Club.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion, which al­lows an opt-out af­ter four years, will be the largest con­tract in NBA his­tory, sur­pass­ing the five-year, US$207 mil­lion con­tract Rus­sell West­brook signed to stay with the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der in 2017.</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning MVP honours for the first time last year, An­te­tok­oun­mpo av­er­aged 29.5 points, 13.6 re­bounds and 5.6 as­sists per game last sea­son to once again earn honours as the best player of the reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>He was also named De­fen­sive Player of the Year last sea­son, join­ing Michael Jor­dan (1987-88) and Ha­keem Ola­ju­won (1993-94) as the only play­ers to win the MVP and de­fen­sive player awards in the same sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Bucks posted the league’s best reg­u­lar-sea­son record in each of the past two sea­sons but have had back-to-back play-off dis­ap­point­ments, which led to con­sid­er­able ap­pre­hen­sion in Mil­wau­kee that An­te­tok­oun­mpo might pass on the ex­ten­sion and choose a new team next sea­son.</p>
    <p>But af­ter a meek sec­ond-round play-off se­ries loss to the Eastern Con­fer­ence cham­pi­ons Mi­ami Heat last term, Bucks of­fi­cials promised the 26-year-old that they would up­grade the ros­ter.</p>
    <p>They duly agreed to a trade last month to ac­quire guard Jrue Hol­i­day from the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans. A planned sign-and-trade deal with the Sacra­mento Kings to ac­quire re­stricted free agent Bog­dan Bog­danovic has fallen through, how­ever.</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s an­nounce­ment ended a nervy pe­riod for the Bucks since the Hol­i­day ac­qui­si­tion, spar­ing the small-mar­ket fran­chise from the flood of con­stant ques­tions about An­te­tok­oun­mpo’s fu­ture as the team try to reach the NBA Fi­nals for the first time since 1974.</p>
