    <p>Last month, Mr K. K. (not his real name) thought he was help­ing the Gov­ern­ment in a se­cret op­er­a­tion to catch hack­ers.</p>
    <p>He was led to be­lieve that by trans­fer­ring $180,000 to a Hong Kong bank ac­count, he could help the au­thor­i­ties track down and nab crim­i­nals who had stolen the per­sonal in­for­ma­tion of many vic­tims.</p>
    <p>As it turned out, the se­nior IT pro­fes­sional had him­self fallen prey to a tech sup­port scam.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia on Wed­nes­day, Mr K. K, who is in his 50s, said he was first con­tacted by a man claim­ing to be a Sing­tel em­ployee on Dec 16.</p>
    <p>The man, who gave his name as “Alex Mur­phy”, told Mr K. K. over the phone that his router had been hacked and any­one could con­nect to his net­work.</p>
    <p>To gain his trust, the scam­mer told Mr K. K what his router’s net­work iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber was.</p>
    <p>“He was not pushy and was very calm. I could not sense any­thing wrong,” said Mr K. K.</p>
    <p>Claim­ing that fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion was nec­es­sary, the scam­mer told Mr K. K. that another Sing­tel staff mem­ber would con­tact him shortly.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond scam­mer, go­ing by the name of “Paul Thomas”, told Mr K. K. that his work com­puter had been com­pro­mised. He con­vinced Mr K. K. to down­load the mon­i­tor­ing soft­ware TeamViewer so that he could check ex­ter­nal IP ad­dresses, which</p>
    <p>might lead to the hack­ers.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did Mr K. K. know that once such ap­pli­ca­tions are in­stalled, scam­mers can re­motely ac­cess vic­tims’ com­put­ers and trans­fer money out of their bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>A third scam­mer, “Eric Lewis”, was then in­tro­duced to Mr K. K. the next day as a “Cy­ber Po­lice Agency” of­fi­cer. There is no such or­gan­i­sa­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr K. K. was asked to sign in to his bank ac­count so that “Eric Lewis” could se­cure his bank­ing ac­cess on the com­puter.</p>
    <p>Un­be­known to him, the scam­mers had trans­ferred $180,000 from one of his bank ac­counts to an ac­count he held with OCBC Bank. “Eric Lewis” then claimed that hack­ers had hi­jacked his bank ac­count for money-laun­der­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Mr K. K. was led to be­lieve that</p>
    <p>by trans­fer­ring the money to an HSBC bank ac­count in Hong Kong, he would be able to help the agency trace the hack­ers’ lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>When Mr K. K. went to OCBC’s branch in Cle­menti on Dec 18 to make a tele­graphic trans­fer, a bank em­ployee de­clined to trans­fer the sum that Mr K. K. claimed was for fam­ily main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>Bank teller Chua Wen Xin, 25, said she be­came sus­pi­cious be­cause when she probed fur­ther, Mr K. K. re­fused to di­vulge how he was re­lated to the re­cip­i­ent.</p>
    <p>On the same day, OCBC alerted the Anti-Scam Cen­tre of the case and po­lice of­fi­cers vis­ited the man’s home to ad­vise him against trans­fer­ring the money.</p>
    <p>Mr K. K. was ini­tially hos­tile to­wards the po­lice of­fi­cers but even­tu­ally came around af­ter he</p>
    <p>checked his bank ac­count and re­alised that the scam­mers had trans­ferred the sum from one of his ac­counts to another.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on his ex­pe­ri­ence, Mr K. K. said: “Next time, I will ask (tech sup­port staff) for some proof of iden­tity and meet them face to face.”</p>
    <p>In the first half of last year, there were 313 cases of tech sup­port scams re­ported to the po­lice – more than 10 times the 30 cases in the same period in 2019.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims lost a to­tal of $14.9 mil­lion, up from $340,000 in the same period in 2019. That makes tech sup­port scams the sec­ond­costli­est scams here last year af­ter in­vest­ment scams, which cheated vic­tims of $22.3 mil­lion.</p>
