    <p>• Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison de­manded that Bei­jing apol­o­gise for a provoca­tive tweet de­pict­ing one of his coun­try’s troops hold­ing a bloody knife to an Afghan child’s throat.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry’s top spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing shot back, ask­ing whether Mr Morrison l acks “a sense of right and wrong”.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse was a hit in China, where Ms Hua drew praise on so­cial me­dia for ex­ud­ing the “style of a great power”. Her deputy, Mr Zhao Li­jian, was sim­i­larly cheered on for pin­ning the of­fend­ing tweet to the top of his Twit­ter feed.</p>
    <p>China’s state me­dia com­plex piled in, pro­mot­ing sto­ries about the min­istry’s re­marks while the Xin­hua News Agency dis­missed Mr Morrison’s de­mand as “ut­terly ab­surd” and the Global Times news­pa­per pub­lished an ed­i­to­rial de­scrib­ing Aus­tralia as “evil”.</p>
    <p>The episode il­lus­trates how China’s diplo­matic rhetoric is in­creas­ingly driven by con­cerns at home, where Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s prom­ise of na­tional re­ju­ve­na­tion and a tor­rent of over­seas crit­i­cism led by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion are fan­ning na­tion­al­is­tic sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>China’s diplo­mats, who re­port­edly once re­ceived cal­cium tablets from cit­i­zens hop­ing they grow some back­bone, are re­cast­ing them­selves as one of the Com­mu­nist Party’s most vo­cal de­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>Diplo­mats such as Mr Zhao and Mr Liu Xiaom­ing, the coun­try’s am­bas­sador to Bri­tain, have be­come celebri­ties on China’s In­ter­net and are widely known as “Wolf Warriors” in a nod to a Rambo-like ac­tion film series. The trend points to more messy dis­putes such as the ones with Aus­tralia and Canada, and raises ques­tions about China’s abil­ity to build soft power to match its eco­nomic and mil­i­tary might.</p>
    <p>“I do think this strat­egy is more about pleas­ing the do­mes­tic au­di­ence,” said com­mu­ni­ca­tions pro­fes­sor Fang Kecheng from the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“It is not work­ing in terms of build­ing China’s image glob­ally. It is work­ing in terms of in­cit­ing na­tion­al­is­tic sen­ti­ment do­mesti</p>
    <p>cally. It is not work­ing per­suad­ing the more lib­eral-minded Chi­nese. It is work­ing in terms of an­swer­ing the call from the top lead­er­ship – and the last thing is what they re­ally care about.”</p>
    <p>The shift is just one way that United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is fac­ing a diplo­matic land­scape that has grown more com­bat­ive af­ter four years of Mr Don­ald Trump’s Twit­ter-driven ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Be­sides dis­miss­ing the com­plaints of world lead­ers such as Mr Morrison or Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau, China’s</p>
    <p>for­eign min­istry has reg­u­larly de­nounced top US of­fi­cials such as Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo as “evil” and “liars”.</p>
    <p>China’s diplo­mats en­joy a cap­tive au­di­ence in a tightly cen­sored me­dia en­vi­ron­ment where Twit­ter and Face­book are banned. The for­eign min­istry has used its state­con­trolled plat­forms to counter over­seas crit­i­cism by high­light­ing what they de­scribe as Western hypocrisy on is­sues like trade, se­cu­rity and hu­man rights, ap­peal­ing to the party’s nar­ra­tive that it ended a “cen­tury of hu­mil­i­a­tion” by colo­nial pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s spokes­men reg­u­larly swing from calling out other coun­tries’ hu­man rights records to rig­or­ously de­fend­ing China’s. Al­le­ga­tions of abuses against Mus­lims in Xin­jiang – in­clud­ing geno­cide claims – are coun­tered, for ex­am­ple, by high­light­ing the US’ treat­ment of Na­tive Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian al­lies in­clud­ing New Zealand and Bri­tain joined Can­berra in con­demn­ing the tweet. The US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil also is­sued a tweet say­ing that Aus­tralian wine will be fea­tured at a White House hol­i­day re­cep­tion this week.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr Morrison sig­nalled a de­sire to avoid es­ca­la­tion in re­marks to law­mak­ers, the Aus­tralian As­so­ci­ated Press re­ported, say­ing he did not want “fur­ther am­pli­fi­ca­tion” of the mat­ter. He also made his own di­rect ap­peal to Chi­nese cit­i­zens by post­ing a mes­sage on WeChat de­fend­ing his “free, demo­cratic, lib­eral coun­try”.</p>
    <p>“The post of a false image of an Aus­tralian sol­dier does not di­min­ish our re­spect for and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of our Chi­nese-Aus­tralian com­mu­nity or in­deed our friend­ship with the peo­ple of China,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Natasha Kas­sam, a for­mer Aus­tralian diplo­mat in China who is now a re­search fel­low at the Sydney-based Lowy In­sti­tute, said: “The logic of Xi Jin­ping’s China, where low-level of­fi­cials are per­form­ing loy­alty tests back to the cen­tre, means there’s very lit­tle chance to admit some­thing has gone wrong.”</p>
