    <p>Shortly be­fore my 50th birth­day 10 years ago, I in­jured one of my knees while play­ing squash.</p>
    <p>My crafty op­po­nent had clev­erly sent me the wrong way and when I tried to pivot around to re­trieve the ball, I felt a sick­en­ing, tear­ing sen­sa­tion in my right knee ac­com­pa­nied by a sharp, ex­cru­ci­at­ing pain.</p>
    <p>I fell to the ground and, im­me­di­ately, the knee swelled up to the size of a small pa­paya. I knew I had rup­tured one of the car­ti­lages or ten­dons in my knee.</p>
    <p>The next day, I ar­ranged for an MRI scan, which con­firmed that I had badly rup­tured my right me­dial menis­cus, one of the car­ti­lagi­nous struc­tures within the knee, that helps to pro­vide sta­bil­ity and a cush­ion­ing ef­fect.</p>
    <p>My mother, who had been wor­ried about me, called me on the phone and I told her about the torn menis­cus.</p>
    <p>She said: “You tore your miniskirts? I didn’t know you had one.”</p>
    <p>Moth­ers.</p>
    <p>It was 6pm by the time I fin­ished the MRI ex­am­i­na­tion and de­cided to take a taxi to my din­ner ap­point­ment, which was some­where in Chi­na­town.</p>
    <p>I was in no con­di­tion to drive, prob­a­bly wouldn’t find a park­ing lot and if I did, would have had to walk a long dis­tance to my des­ti­na­tion, which I could not do in my in­jured state.</p>
    <p>But I wanted to at­tend the din­ner. I was feel­ing mis­er­able and needed some cheer­ing up. A cab was the best so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The taxi un­cle was an older man, but still looked fit and ro­bust. He was very chatty and we eas­ily struck up a con­ver­sa­tion. I told him about my re­cent in­jury and he smiled re­as­sur­ingly.</p>
    <p>“Never mind, it’s just a tear, it will re­cover.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a while, he said: “If you meet me when I am not driv­ing this taxi, you will never think I am a taxi driver.”</p>
    <p>I was puz­zled by the state­ment. “Why is that?” I asked.</p>
    <p>“Well, look at me... do you see any­thing dif­fer­ent?” he teased.</p>
    <p>I did not know what he was hint­ing at. He looked per­fectly nor­mal to me.</p>
    <p>“Oh, I know,” I ven­tured. “You look like a banker or stock­bro­ker. Is that it? Or were you a lawyer be­fore?” I asked, think­ing he was one of those who had suf­fered a mid-life job cri­sis.</p>
    <p>‘No, no. Look at my wind­screen. What do you see?” he asked.</p>
    <p>I looked up to scru­ti­nise the de­cals there and that was when I saw the “dis­abled” sticker in the top left-hand cor­ner.</p>
    <p>“I am a hand­i­capped man. I have po­lio. In both legs. But yet I can drive a taxi. I am the first in Sin­ga­pore, you know,” said the driver proudly, who later re­vealed his name was Alex.</p>
    <p>“That’s fan­tas­tic, Alex. How on earth did you man­age that?”</p>
    <p>I asked with grow­ing ad­mi­ra­tion for this man.</p>
    <p>I had only an in­jured knee, but here was this gentle­man, phys­i­cally dis­abled in both legs yet still earn­ing his liv­ing as a taxi driver.</p>
    <p>How could I feel sorry for my­self in the pres­ence of such de­ter­mi­na­tion and dig­nity?</p>
    <p>He then pro­ceeded to tell me his story. He had been stricken with po­lio more than 50 years ago when he was just three years old and was hos­pi­talised till he was 12. Nine years stuck on a hos­pi­tal bed.</p>
    <p>Upon dis­charge, no pri­mary school would take him in as a stu­dent as they con­sid­ered him too old. His mother went to many schools, plead­ing with them to give him a place, but to no avail.</p>
    <p>So he had to learn how to read and write on his own. He there­after en­coun­tered great dif­fi­cul­ties se­cur­ing jobs and wan­dered from odd job to odd job.</p>
    <p>He had worked as a tele­phone op­er­a­tor, a typ­ist, a clerk, an of­fice worker – any­thing that could feed him.</p>
    <p>“When you are hand­i­capped, no one wants to hire you lah. It’s very dif­fi­cult for the hand­i­capped in Sin­ga­pore. There are wel­fare and spe­cial priv­i­leges for the el­derly, the poor, the blind, but none for the dis­abled like me,” he lamented.</p>
    <p>“We have to look af­ter our­selves, make our own liv­ing (if any­one wants to hire us) and end up with lower salary over oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Do you know that in ev­ery job I was in, they al­ways gave me less than oth­ers of the same rank?</p>
    <p>Just be­cause I am dis­abled.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple take ad­van­tage of us. We have to buy bread and rice at the same price just like ev­ery­one else, but we don’t earn what oth­ers do.”</p>
    <p>He spoke very elo­quently and drove ex­pertly too.</p>
    <p>I felt guilty be­cause I had never thought of how a dis­abled per­son earns a liv­ing and what sup­port mech­a­nisms there are for them.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally sorry to hear that. I thought the Gov­ern­ment helped in some way?” I said.</p>
    <p>He snorted. “Ha! We don’t even get con­ces­sions for tak­ing pub­lic trans­port and we buy flats at the same price as ev­ery­one else does. What sup­port do we get? None. You think that’s fair?”</p>
    <p>“I had no idea,” I con­ceded. “Surely there must be a way to change this?”</p>
    <p>He then told me about how he got his taxi li­cence from the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, he al­ready had a mo­tor­bike li­cence from 1986 and a driv­ing li­cence from 1988, but when he ap­plied for the taxi li­cence two years ago, he was re­jected twice on the grounds that he was dis­abled and would pose a threat to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t un­der­stand their rea­son­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is the same gov­ern­ment agency that had al­ready given me a driv­ing li­cence and I have been driv­ing for more than</p>
    <p>20 years with no mishap, yet they can’t grant me a taxi li­cence. Where got logic, man? So I went down to see the of­fi­cer to tell him this.”</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, at the in­ter­view, an an­noyed Alex told the of­fi­cer: “You have no com­mon sense to keep re­ject­ing me. I may be phys­i­cally hand­i­capped, but you are men­tally hand­i­capped.”</p>
    <p>“Gosh. That was dar­ing. Then what hap­pened?” I asked.</p>
    <p>“They gave me the li­cence,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How won­der­ful. At least the of­fi­cer was amenable to rea­son and could change his de­ci­sion once the facts were pre­sented to him. That shows that our gov­ern­ment of­fi­cers can think on their feet. I feel re­as­sured,” was my re­join­der.</p>
    <p>“Yes, in this in­stance, they came through, but there are so many of us dis­abled who dare not speak up and fight for their rights. They just ac­cept their fate.</p>
    <p>“Me, I will fight. I don’t care what peo­ple think about me. What is most im­por­tant is what I think of my­self.”</p>
    <p>And with those sober­ing words, the taxi ride came to an end.</p>
