    <p>Ms Ho See Jia, 34, co-founder, Habasselet De­sign</p>
    <p>The most im­por­tant thing to con­sider is how a car­pet will bal­ance the ex­ist­ing space.</p>
    <p>Good de­sign hinges on a skil­fully cu­rated mix: the bal­ance of colours, of light and dark ar­eas, of “busy-ness” and quiet­ness of de­tail.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, an in­tri­cately pat­terned car­pet in a toned-down, quiet space would add vis­ual bal­ance and func­tion as a cen­tre­piece while the same car­pet may clash with other fea­tures in a busily dec­o­rated room.</p>
    <p>An­other im­por­tant fea­ture is the floor of a room, which often gets side­lined in de­sign de­ci­sions and bud­get­ing con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The floor has vis­ual weight, an­chor­ing and set­ting the mood of the space.</p>
    <p>An area rug is a good way of chang­ing the floor with­out do­ing ex­ten­sive work. It can be sur­pris­ing how just a small colour­ful rug, for ex­am­ple, can brighten up an oth­er­wise dark and gloomy room.</p>
    <p>In larger spa­ces, the right choice of car­pet dis­tin­guishes sep­a­rate func­tions such as the liv­ing space and the din­ing area, giv­ing each its own spe­cial at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­die Tay, 38, di­vi­sion di­rec­tor, Fuse Con­cept</p>
    <p>A car­pet in the liv­ing room, for in­stance, has a func­tional role in the over­all de­sign scheme be­cause it re­duces noise and pro­vides a com­fort­able walk­ing sur­face. De­pend­ing on the size, style and shape of the car­pet, it can add to the over­all am­bi­ence.</p>
    <p>The right car­pet in the liv­ing room will help sep­a­rate the space into ei­ther smaller or larger por­tions, and make the floor look softer or warmer, de­pend­ing on the car­pet de­sign.</p>
    <p>While there is no short­age of car­pets to choose from these days, it is im­por­tant to make a de­ci­sion based on func­tion­al­ity, bud­get, the pre­ferred style and size of the car­pet.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Chua, 43, founder, Sync In­te­ri­ors</p>
    <p>Car­pets play a sig­nif­i­cant role in in­te­rior spa­ces.</p>
    <p>One of the al­most im­me­di­ate ef­fects is that they give con­trast to the colour scheme of fur­ni­ture such as the sofa, cof­fee ta­ble or TV con­sole.</p>
    <p>To get the most out of shop­ping for a car­pet, con­sider set­ting a bud­get first: Is it a low- or high-end car­pet that is best suited to your room?</p>
    <p>Also, con­sider the needs of chil­dren or pets. If nec­es­sary, opt for a low-main­te­nance rug if you do not have time to fuss over or take care of your car­pet.</p>
    <p>Lastly, look at the over­all theme you want to project. This also cre­ates an emo­tion in the de­sign and re­flects your per­son­al­ity in the liv­ing space.</p>
