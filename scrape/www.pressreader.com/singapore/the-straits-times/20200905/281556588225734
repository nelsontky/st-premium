    <p>Re­tail sales shot up in July as the be­lea­guered sec­tor con­tin­ues its re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 crunch. Turnover surged 27.4 per cent over June lev­els on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, helped in part by a lower base in June, the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is chang­ing many in­dus­tries at warp speed, with in­sur­ance at the fore­front of the new wave of trans­for­ma­tion, as HSBC Life Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Car­los Vazquez knows all too well.</p>
    <p>Mr Vazquez told The Straits Times that the in­sur­ance sec­tor has “changed more in the past six months than in the past 10 years”.</p>
    <p>Much of that has to do with pro­cesses tra­di­tion­ally done face to face hav­ing to move on­line – fast.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers re­ally ap­pre­ci­ate choice and they are be­com­ing more com­fort­able with on­line pro­cesses and call­ing their re­la­tion­ship man­agers on Zoom,” added Mr Vazquez.</p>
    <p>He said that the in­surer is im­prov­ing its vir­tual sales pro­cesses and mak­ing more prod­ucts avail­able to re­tail bank­ing cus­tomers as de­mand from that seg­ment grows, while stay­ing fo­cused on its niche in the high-net-worth mar­ket.</p>
    <p>HSBC Life Sin­ga­pore’s distri­bu­tion model in­cludes a ban­cas­sur­ance set-up with HSBC Bank and third-party distri­bu­tion ar­range­ments with fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firms and other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Its head­count has grown by more than 25 per cent since Mr Vazquez took the reins in 2018.</p>
    <p>New busi­ness, in terms of to­tal weighted pre­mi­ums, grew by about 20 per cent last year, al­though the firm could not give ex­act fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The in­surer has re­cently in­tro­duced sev­eral new prod­ucts tar­geted at re­tail cus­tomers, with a fo­cus on re­tire­ment plan­ning.</p>
    <p>These in­clude a vari­able an­nu­ity pol­icy launched ear­lier this year, which aims to pro­vide guar­an­teed monthly re­tire­ment in­come, the abil­ity to ben­e­fit from ris­ing mar­kets, and risk pro­tec­tion. It in­volves a one-time premium of at least US$50,000 (S$68,000).</p>
    <p>“It is de­signed for older cus­tomers who al­ready have some re­tire­ment sav­ings and are ner­vous about the mar­ket,” said Mr Vazquez.</p>
    <p>An­other prod­uct, the HSBC Life Re­tire­ment In­come sav­ings en­dow­ment plan, tar­gets younger cus­tomers whose “am­bi­tions are 20 or 30 years down the road”. It was launched in Au­gust last year, and al­lows cus­tomers to choose their de­sired amount of guar­an­teed monthly pay­out, premium term and in­come pay­out pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Vazquez said re­tire­ment prod­ucts are rapidly gain­ing trac­tion as peo­ple are more aware of the need to save for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He cited a 2018 HSBC study which found that 72 per cent of workingage re­spon­dents here were con­cerned about run­ning out of money in re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>“The best ap­proach to sav­ing for re­tire­ment is multi-pronged – you can rely on some money from fam­ily and chil­dren and some form of gov­ern­ment sup­port, but you also need to start sav­ing your­self,” he said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides zoom­ing in on spe­cific de­mand, HSBC Life Sin­ga­pore is in­vest­ing in tools such as a dis­trib­u­tor por­tal to make it eas­ier for distri­bu­tion part­ners to do busi­ness with it.</p>
    <p>It has also ex­panded into on­line prod­ucts for in­di­vid­ual cus­tomers – a pure pro­tec­tion term prod­uct, and a sin­gle-premium en­dow­ment plan that was fully sub­scribed in two weeks upon its launch last year.</p>
    <p>HSBC Life Sin­ga­pore be­came a Tier 1 in­surer in 2017. This means it has met cer­tain re­quire­ments: a direct life or com­pos­ite in­surer with to­tal as­sets of at least $5 bil­lion. Tier 1 in­sur­ers are sub­ject to higher cor­po­rate gover­nance stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The firm had close to $7 bil­lion in to­tal as­sets at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Its main strength has been in the high-net-worth mar­ket, said Mr Vazquez.</p>
    <p>Its flag­ship prod­ucts – the Jade Legacy Univer­sal and Emer­ald Legacy life plans – tar­get cus­tomers with wealth of more than $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Guan, as­so­ciate direc­tor at fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory PromiseLan­d In­de­pen­dent, said HSBC Life Sin­ga­pore’s grow­ing fo­cus on re­tail cus­tomers is sim­i­lar to how many fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are di­ver­si­fy­ing into var­i­ous seg­ments to avoid con­cen­tra­tion risk.</p>
    <p>He added: “In Asia, es­pe­cially Sin­ga­pore, many peo­ple don’t qual­ify to be high-net-worth clients but they have a lot of sav­ings and in­sur­ance needs. Mean­while, com­pe­ti­tion is fierce in the high-net-worth space.”</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Aurobindo Ghosh from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s (SMU) Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness said: “The main is­sue banks are grap­pling with is the in­tro­duc­tion of prod­ucts and ser­vices that en­cour­age in­clu­sion, broadly de­fined as ac­cess to fi­nan­cial ser­vices for the mass mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ghosh, who is the pro­gramme direc­tor of the Citi-SMU Fi­nan­cial Lit­er­acy Pro­gramme for Young Adults, added: “Com­pe­ti­tion is a good thing as it drives down prices for re­tail con­sumers and in­creases choice.”</p>
