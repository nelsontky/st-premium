    <p>Lo­cal banks should sus­tain their cap­i­tal ra­tios at around 14 per cent over the next few years or they could risk trig­ger­ing a rat­ing down­grade, said Fitch Rat­ings.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing comes as de­te­ri­o­rat­ing as­set qual­ity and prof­itabil­ity are likely to hit cap­i­tal ra­tios at a time when there is “lim­ited rat­ing head­room”, the credit rat­ings agency said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The three banks are rated AA- and have been put on rat­ing watch neg­a­tive by Fitch Rat­ings to re­flect the weak­en­ing op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>All three have tar­geted for com­mon eq­uity Tier 1 (CET1) ra­tios be­tween 12.5 per cent and 13.5 per cent. DBS Bank’s CET1 ra­tio stood at 13.7 per cent as of the sec­ond quar­ter, OCBC Bank at 14.2 per cent and United Over­seas Bank (UOB) at 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>Fitch Rat­ings said such tar­gets will be “in­con­sis­tent with cur­rent scor­ing” if there is no cred­i­ble plan to re­store them “within a rea­son­able hori­zon”.</p>
    <p>“The cap­i­tal score is likely to be low­ered should the banks sus­tain CET1 ra­tios well be­low 14 per cent with­out a cred­i­ble plan to re­build them to around 14 per cent within the next cou­ple of years.”</p>
    <p>It did note that the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s call for banks to cap div­i­dends for this year will “go some way” in help­ing them main­tain cap­i­tal ra­tios at a level “com­men­su­rate with risk” for the year.</p>
    <p>Fitch Rat­ings added that this has saved the banks up to 40 ba­sis points of cap­i­tal each.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the agency has a neg­a­tive out­look on the banks’ earn­ings and prof­itabil­ity scores, which im­plies a risk to prof­itabil­ity mainly due to im­pair­ments that are “larger than cur­rently ex­pected”.</p>
    <p>Fitch Rat­ings ex­pects the lenders’ earn­ings this year to fall by about a third from the end of last year. In turn, credit mi­gra­tion is likely to have an im­pact on their cap­i­tal ra­tios.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond quar­ter, all three banks recorded a sharp dive in earn­ings as bench­mark rates col­lapsed and the trio lifted pro­vi­sions. DBS’ net profit fell 22 per cent to $1.2 bil­lion, OCBC’s slumped 40 per cent to $730 mil­lion, while UOB’s tum­bled 40 per cent to $703 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Net in­ter­est mar­gin (NIM) com­pres­sion started late last year, with a big drop in the sec­ond quar­ter as the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Si­bor) fell sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect con­tin­ued mar­gin com­pres­sion due to the lag ef­fect of Si­bor re­duc­tion, which will pres­sure rev­enues for 2020. We be­lieve mar­gins are likely to be flat in 2021,” said Fitch Rat­ings.</p>
    <p>NIM in the sec­ond quar­ter stood at 1.62 per cent for DBS, 1.6 per cent for OCBC and 1.48 per cent for UOB.</p>
    <p>The agency said there may be some resid­ual lag from fall­ing bench­mark rates, although banks are likely to price new loans higher, given the po­ten­tially higher in­cre­men­tal risk, less com­pe­ti­tion in the market and po­ten­tially tighter liq­uid­ity. Banks have also been cut­ting de­posit rates to lift mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Fitch Rat­ings has pro­jected for non-per­form­ing loan (NPL) ra­tios to peak at a lit­tle over 3 per cent next year for the trio. As they con­tinue to build buf­fers in the sec­ond quar­ter, all three have kept to their ear­lier guid­ance from the first quar­ter. Sec­ond-quar­ter NPL ra­tios re­mained steady at 1.6 per cent for OCBC and UOB, and at 1.5 per cent for DBS.</p>
    <p>“Reg­u­la­tory re­lief has gen­er­ally held NPLs sta­ble (so far this year),” said the agency.</p>
    <p>But it warned that the full ex­tent of the pan­demic’s im­pact may be re­flected only in next year’s NPL ra­tios, as debt re­pay­ment mora­to­ria of­fered to bor­row­ers will de­lay much im­paired-loans recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>That said, the banks are ex­pected to con­tinue to book sig­nif­i­cant gen­eral pro­vi­sions this year. “We give the Sin­ga­pore banks ben­e­fit for their high lev­er­age ra­tios,” Fitch Rat­ings said.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect all three... to con­tinue to gen­er­ate prof­its through­out the down­turn, with the trough be­ing in 2020.”</p>
