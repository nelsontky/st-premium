    <p>A If it is hearsay, do not jump to con­clu­sions, says a spokesman for the In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als (IHRP).</p>
    <p>Find out more by speak­ing to your man­ager or union rep­re­sen­ta­tive and check if a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise has al­ready been con­firmed by com­pany man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>If there re­ally are re­trench­ments com­ing, Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay says, one of the key things to con­sider is whether you are el­i­gi­ble to re­ceive any re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, based on your em­ploy­ment con­tract or col­lec­tive agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“Re­trench­ment ben­e­fits are meant to help you tide through the job search pe­riod, be­fore you em­bark on your next job. If re­trench­ment ben­e­fits are payable, you will not re­ceive them – as­sum­ing the com­pany can pay – if you re­sign in­stead of be­ing re­trenched,” he says.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are not legally re­quired to pay re­trench­ment ben­e­fits – the law states only that em­ploy­ees who have worked for an em­ployer for less than two years are not en­ti­tled to the pay­outs – but most do.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment last month that about nine in 10 el­i­gi­ble em­ploy­ees re­ceived a pay­out when they lost their jobs, based on min­istry data for April to Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The IHRP spokesman sug­gests three pos­si­ble sce­nar­ios when con­sid­er­ing your next move.</p>
    <p>• Sce­nario 1: If you know there will be re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, and you do not yet have a con­firmed job, it might be bet­ter to re­ceive such ben­e­fits than to re­sign.</p>
    <p>• Sce­nario 2: If you know that there will be no re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, it may be pru­dent to re­sign only af­ter you have se­cured your next job, or even pay in lieu of no­tice or mu­tu­ally agree with your cur­rent com­pany to exit ear­lier, so that you can start ear­lier at your next job and se­cure longer-term fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>• Sce­nario 3: If you do not know whether there are re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, and you al­ready have a next job of­fered to you, it may be bet­ter to re­sign and se­cure your next job – even if means for­go­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of re­trench­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>“This is a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion to be in, so please take care of your health and well-be­ing, and stay pos­i­tive. Seek pro­fes­sional help if you are feel­ing stressed, or speak to some­one you trust and who cares for you,” says the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay en­cour­ages any­one who is re­trenched to take ad­van­tage of the lull pe­riod to pick up rel­e­vant and/or new skills in or­der to in­crease your em­ploy­a­bil­ity and land your next job.</p>
    <p>When ap­ply­ing for jobs, the ques­tion of why you left your pre­vi­ous job may come up. I HRP’s spokesman rec­om­mends be­ing clear and hon­est about your rea­sons for leav­ing your last job, while em­pha­sis­ing the value you can bring to the new role.</p>
    <p>Q What is a dis­guised re­trench­ment?</p>
    <p>A Tri­par­tite guide­lines state that a dis­missed em­ployee is pre­sumed to have been re­trenched if the em­ployer can­not show a plan to fill the va­cancy any time soon.</p>
    <p>A dis­guised re­trench­ment is where a com­pany takes cost-cut­ting mea­sures and re­trenches em­ploy­ees with no in­ten­tion of filling the va­can­cies, but calls it con­trac­tual ter­mi­na­tion – which means exercising the em­ployer’s con­trac­tual right to end the em­ploy­ment re­la­tion­ship with no­tice, or pay­ment in lieu of no­tice, ac­cord­ing to the con­tract, says Mr Tay.</p>
    <p>The com­pany could be try­ing to avoid pay­ing the af­fected em­ploy­ees a fair re­trench­ment pack­age.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) spokesman says that where there are com­plaints about em­ploy­ers mis­clas­si­fy­ing a re­trench­ment, MOM will in­ves­ti­gate and me­di­ate.</p>
    <p>The spokesman adds that em­ploy­ers found to have mis­clas­si­fied their re­trench­ments will have gov­ern­ment sup­port – such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme – with­drawn or their work pass priv­i­leges sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Is there any re­course if I be­lieve I am owed re­trench­ment ben­e­fits?</p>
    <p>A Mr Tay ad­vises union mem­bers to ap­proach their unions, which will try to work am­i­ca­bly with the em­ployer to se­cure the pay­ment. If the com­pany is un­co­op­er­a­tive, the union may ap­ply for ar­bi­tra­tion with the In­dus­trial Ar­bi­tra­tion Court. Mr Tay has rep­re­sented unions and union mem­bers in such cases be­fore.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees can also ap­proach MOM for help.</p>
    <p>If your em­ploy­ment con­tract or col­lec­tive agree­ment pro­vides for re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, you can file a claim with the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>But Mr Tay notes that if your em­ployer can show doc­u­men­tary ev­i­dence that he is in se­vere fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties, you may not re­ceive the full re­trench­ment pack­age that you are el­i­gi­ble to re­ceive.</p>
    <p>If your em­ploy­ment con­tract or col­lec­tive agree­ment pro­vides for re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, you can file a claim with the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment.</p>
