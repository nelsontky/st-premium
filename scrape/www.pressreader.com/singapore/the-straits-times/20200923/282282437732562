    <p>Fi­nan­cial ser­vice com­pany GoBear and cash­back plat­form ShopBack are among 10 Sin­ga­pore start-ups to watch, ac­cord­ing to net­work­ing site LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>The top 10 have re­mained re­silient de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and have con­tin­ued to draw in­vest­ments and hire new work­ers, LinkedIn said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It com­piled the in­au­gu­ral list by as­sess­ing four key met­rics, based on its own data from Jan­uary to July: em­ploy­ment growth, en­gage­ment on the com­pany’s LinkedIn page, in­ter­est in jobs of­fered by the com­pany and at­trac­tion of top tal­ent.</p>
    <p>The list also in­cludes gam­ing chair man­u­fac­turer Se­cret­lab, re­cruit­ment plat­form Glints, big-data com­pany Ad­vance.AI, care­giv­ing ser­vice com­pany Homage, cos­metic den­tal busi­ness Zenyum, wealth man­age­ment plat­form StashAway, on­line food de­liv­ery com­pany Grain and co-liv­ing op­er­a­tor Hm­let.</p>
    <p>These start-ups point to grow­ing busi­ness trends in ar­eas rang­ing from dig­i­tal health to e-com­merce, and in­di­cate fu­ture ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties, LinkedIn said.</p>
    <p>ShopBack, for ex­am­ple, has been rid­ing the ac­cel­er­ated growth of ecom­merce dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It of­fi­cially launched its Viet­nam busi­ness last month, and drew ad­di­tional fund­ing from in­vestors such as Te­masek, Rakuten and the Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board’s in­vest­ment arm ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>While GoBear an­nounced it was lay­ing off 22 work­ers – or about 10 per cent of its global work­force – ear­lier this month, it has ex­panded its cor­po­rate part­ner­ships over the past year. These in­clude a prod­uct un­der­writ­ten by in­surer Chubb tar­geted at em­ploy­ees who work from home.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Grain ex­panded to</p>
    <p>Thai­land in May, and linked up with bub­ble tea chain Koi dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker here, when bub­ble tea out­lets were not al­lowed to open.</p>
    <p>LinkedIn News se­nior ed­i­tor for Asia Chris An­der­son noted that com­pa­nies of all sizes have had to pivot, adapt and change to sur­vive and thrive amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“The in­au­gu­ral list is a re­flec­tion of this shift­ing land­scape and shines a light on those start-ups in Sin­ga­pore which are lead­ing the way across in­dus­tries such as re­tail, on­line de­liv­ery, per­sonal fi­nance, med­i­cal de­vices, AI (ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence) and more,” he said.</p>
    <p>Start-ups that cut 20 per cent or more of their work­force from Jan­uary to July were deemed in­el­i­gi­ble for the list.</p>
    <p>Staffing firms; think-tanks; ven­ture cap­i­tal firms; law, man­age­ment and in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy con­sult­ing com­pa­nies; non-prof­its and phi­lan­thropy or­gan­i­sa­tions; accelerato­rs and gov­ern­ment-owned en­ti­ties were also ex­cluded.</p>
