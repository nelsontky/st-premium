    <p>HONG KONG • All over the world, workers are soap­ing, wip­ing and fu­mi­gat­ing sur­faces with an ur­gent sense of pur­pose: to fight the Covid-19 dis­ease.</p>
    <p>But sci­en­tists in­creas­ingly say there is lit­tle to no ev­i­dence that con­tam­i­nated sur­faces can spread the virus. In crowded in­door spa­ces like air­ports, they say, the virus that is ex­haled by in­fected peo­ple and that lingers in the air is a much greater threat.</p>
    <p>Hand wash­ing with soap and wa­ter for 20 sec­onds – or sani­tiser in the ab­sence of soap – is still en­cour­aged to stop the virus’ spread. But scrub­bing sur­faces does lit­tle to mit­i­gate the virus threat in­doors, ex­perts say, and health of­fi­cials are be­ing urged to fo­cus in­stead on im­prov­ing ven­ti­la­tion and fil­tra­tion of in­door air.</p>
    <p>“In my opinion, a lot of time, en</p>
    <p>ergy and money is be­ing wasted on sur­face dis­in­fec­tion and, more im­por­tantly, di­vert­ing at­ten­tion and re­sources away from pre­vent­ing air­borne trans­mis­sion,” said Dr Kevin Fen­nelly, a res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion spe­cial­ist with the US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health.</p>
    <p>In July, an es­say in The Lancet med­i­cal jour­nal ar­gued that some sci­en­tists had ex­ag­ger­ated the risk of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion from sur­faces with­out con­sid­er­ing ev­i­dence from stud­ies of its closely re­lated cousins, in­clud­ing Sars-CoV,</p>
    <p>the driver of the 2002-2003 Sars epi­demic.</p>
    <p>“This is ex­tremely strong ev­i­dence that at least for the orig­i­nal Sars virus, fomite trans­mis­sion was very mi­nor at most,” the es­say’s author, mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist Emanuel Gold­man of Rut­gers Univer­sity, said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>“There is no rea­son to ex­pect that the close rel­a­tive Sars-CoV-2 would be­have sig­nif­i­cantly dif­fer­ent in this kind of ex­per­i­ment,” he added, re­fer­ring to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
