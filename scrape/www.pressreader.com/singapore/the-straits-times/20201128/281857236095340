    <p>• North Korea has greeted the last two US pres­i­dents with tests of mis­siles or nu­clear bombs within weeks of tak­ing of­fice. And ex­perts see some­thing sim­i­lar hap­pen­ing with Mr Joe Bi­den, whom the regime has called “a ra­bid dog”.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim Jong Un is one of the few world lead­ers who have yet to con­grat­u­late – or even ac­knowl­edge – the Pres­i­dent-elect, after Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping did so on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>While it’s not un­usual for North Korea to stay silent on the re­sults of US elec­tions, Mr Kim held un­prece­dented meet­ings with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump that broke the mould of re­la­tions be­tween the long-time ad­ver­saries. Ties now are poised to re­vert to the frostier days of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, when the US de­ployed “strate­gic pa­tience” to avoid re­ward­ing North Korea for provo­ca­tions – a pol­icy that stayed in place after Mr Kim took power in 2011.</p>
    <p>For North Korea, it may not make too much of a dif­fer­ence: Un­der both Mr Barack Obama and Mr Trump, Mr Kim steadily in­creased his abil­ity to threaten the US home­land with nu­clear weapons even in the face of ever-tighter sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The most likely mis­sile test this time will be an­other ICBM. This could in­clude a new rocket North Korea rolled out at a mil­i­tary pa­rade in Oc­to­ber, which is de­signed to carry mul­ti­ple nu­clear war­heads to the US home­land.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang has made clear that it prefers deal­ing with Mr Trump, who gave Mr Kim a seat at the ta­ble as an equal.</p>
    <p>His regime has ex­tolled the “mys­te­ri­ously won­der­ful” chem­istry be­tween the two lead­ers, while de­nounc­ing Mr Bi­den as an “im­be­cile bereft of the ele­men­tary qual­ity as a hu­man be­ing”.</p>
    <p>And as Mr Bi­den seeks to work with allies fol­low­ing Mr Trump’s “Amer­ica First” ap­proach, Mr Kim may also find that he has more friends now than he did a few years ago. He en­joys much bet­ter re­la­tions with China and Rus­sia, who joined with the US in 2017 to sup­port un­prece­dented United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil sanc­tions against North Korea.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s camp has sig­nalled more room for ne­go­ti­a­tions, say­ing in a pol­icy pa­per that he wants to “jump-start” a cam­paign with US allies and oth­ers for denucleari­sation.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim is likely to give clues on how he’ll ap­proach the new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion dur­ing an an­nual New Year’s ad­dress – one of the big­gest po­lit­i­cal speeches on the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal cal­en­dar. North Korea is also ex­pected to hold a rare rul­ing party congress at around the time of Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion to lay out a new five-year plan for its econ­omy, which is headed for its big­gest con­trac­tion in more than two decades due to sanc­tions, the coro­n­avirus and a se­ries of nat­u­ral dis­as­ters.</p>
