    <p>A woman will, for the first time, be the se­nior pres­i­dent of the Syariah Court, from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>From Satur­day, Ms Guy Ghaz­ali, 38, will un­der­study cur­rent se­nior pres­i­dent Al­fian Yas­rif Ku­chit, 42, as the se­nior pres­i­dent-des­ig­nate be­fore tak­ing on the role, said the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She will be the fourth se­nior pres­i­dent of the Syariah Court.</p>
    <p>The Syariah Court, l ocated in Bukit Merah, is an Is­lamic re­li­gious court that han­dles Mus­lim di­vorces and in­her­i­tance mat­ters ac­cord­ing to Mus­lim law.</p>
    <p>The re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of Syariah Court pres­i­dents in­clude hear­ing and mak­ing judg­ments and or­ders on divorce cases.</p>
    <p>The se­lec­tion of a se­nior pres­i­dent is based on strin­gent cri­te­ria, in­clud­ing the can­di­date’s qual­i­fi­ca­tions, ex­pe­ri­ence and tem­per­a­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Guy is a Le­gal Ser­vice of­fi­cer and cur­rently a district judge and as­sis­tant reg­is­trar in the Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts.</p>
    <p>She has served on the board that hears ap­peals against de­ci­sions made by the Syariah Court and the Registry of Mus­lim Mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Be­fore join­ing the Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts, she was a lawyer in pri­vate prac­tice, mainly prac­tis­ing fam­ily law, which in­cluded cases heard in the Syariah Court and the Ap­peal Board.</p>
    <p>The Mufti of Sin­ga­pore, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, who is the coun­try’s high­est Is­lamic au­thor­ity and over­sees key re­li­gious rul­ings for Mus­lims here, said: “The ju­di­ciary is a com­plex in­sti­tu­tion that re­quires a high level of ex­per­tise in var­i­ous dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>“With her depth of knowl­edge of the Sin­ga­pore le­gal sys­tem and her ex­pe­ri­ence in Mus­lim fam­ily law through her work in the Ap­peal Board, I am con­fi­dent that Ms Guy is well placed to lead the Syariah Court as well as develop our asati­zah, who can be fu­ture Syariah Court judges.”</p>
    <p>Asati­zah refers to re­li­gious teach­ers.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment yes­ter­day, MCCY stressed the im­por­tance of en­sur­ing that the Syariah Court is helmed by asati­zah who are trained in both Mus­lim and civil law as the needs of Mus­lim fam­i­lies evolve and di­vorces be­come more com­plex.</p>
    <p>The out­go­ing se­nior pres­i­dent, Us­taz Al­fian, first served as pres­i­dent of the Syariah Court from 2011 to 2014. He as­sumed the post of se­nior pres­i­dent in 2017 fol­low­ing a stint in MCCY.</p>
    <p>Us­taz Al­fian, who will re­turn to the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis), will con­tinue to serve as an ad-hoc pres­i­dent of the Syariah Court while pur­su­ing a PhD at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Fac­ulty of Law.</p>
    <p>Dr Nazirudin has ex­pressed his ap­pre­ci­a­tion to Us­taz Al­fian.</p>
    <p>“Us­taz Al­fian has led the Syariah Court with distinc­tion as the first se­nior pres­i­dent trained in both Mus­lim and civil law,” said the Mufti.</p>
    <p>“I am pleased to know that he will con­tinue to serve in the Syariah Court as an ad-hoc pres­i­dent as well as con­trib­ute in de­vel­op­ing re­li­gious ex­per­tise among asati­zah in the prac­tice of Mus­lim fam­ily law.”</p>
    <p>WELL PLACED TO LEAD</p>
    <p>The ju­di­ciary is a com­plex in­sti­tu­tion that re­quires a high level of ex­per­tise in var­i­ous dis­ci­plines. With her depth of knowl­edge of the Sin­ga­pore le­gal sys­tem and her ex­pe­ri­ence in Mus­lim fam­ily law through her work in the Ap­peal Board, I am con­fi­dent that Ms Guy is well placed to lead the Syariah Court as well as develop our asati­zah who can be fu­ture ’’</p>
    <p>Syariah Court judges.</p>
    <p>DR NAZIRUDIN MOHD NASIR, the Mufti of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
